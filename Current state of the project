WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR

The main idea is the study and comparison of the popularity boost gained by Eurovision 2021 winners, with a focus on Maneskin because they arrived 
first place and they're a good case study in general.

1. The tweets
We have retrieved tweets regarding the first 6 artists classified in the timespan May 10 - June 6. This has been done gathering all tweets containing
mentions of the official accounts of the artists or hashtags related to them. Each artist has its own set of tweets in .pkl format. Then, every set of
tweets has been split into 4 weeks and also converted to .csv. Finally, the english tweets from each artist have been extracted, their text has been
cleaned, and only some relevant columns have been kept, in order to produce an input file for the sentiment analysis software (the LIWC). The same has
been done with the italian Maneskin tweets because I found an italian sentiment dictionary that could be used (the Sentix).
All tweets are available in the "tweets" folder.

2. Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis of the english tweets has been automatically performed by the LIWC. The results can be found in the results_liwc.zip file.
For italian tweets, the tone of each tweet has been calculated with a script that averaged on the sentiment of each (relevant) word, that being
obtained by matching tokenized words with the ones contained in the Sentix dictionary. The .csv with all the italian Maneskin tweets and their respective
emotional tone can be found in the folder (TO BE UPLOADED).
