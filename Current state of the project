WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR

The main idea is the study and comparison of the popularity boost gained by Eurovision 2021 winners, with a focus on Maneskin because they arrived 
first place and they're a good case study in general.

1. The tweets
We have retrieved tweets regarding the first 6 artists classified in the timespan May 10 - June 6. This has been done gathering all tweets containing
mentions of the official accounts of the artists or hashtags related to them. Each artist has its own set of tweets in .pkl format. Then, every set of
tweets has been split into 4 weeks and also converted to .csv. Finally, the english tweets from each artist have been extracted, their text has been
cleaned, and only some relevant columns have been kept, in order to produce an input file for the sentiment analysis software (the LIWC). The same has
been done with the italian Maneskin tweets because I found an italian sentiment dictionary that could be used (the Sentix).
All tweets are available in the "tweets" folder.

2. Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis of the english tweets has been automatically performed by the LIWC. The results can be found in the results_liwc.zip file.
For italian tweets, the tone of each tweet has been calculated with a script that averaged on the sentiment of each (relevant) word, that being
obtained by matching tokenized words with the ones contained in the Sentix dictionary. The .csv with all the italian Maneskin tweets and their respective
emotional tone can be found in the folder (TO BE UPLOADED).

3. The modularity analysis
Semantic networks have been created for each week of Maneskin tweets, both italian and english. The nodes are the words, they include the number of times
the word has been used during the week in the count field. The edges link together words that appear in the same tweet, and their weight is how many times
that happens. For each network, many metrics have been extracted and a filtered version of it has been visualized with words of different colour based on
the modularity class (community) they belong to and word size depending on their eigenvector centrality. Filtering was needed in order to obtain a clean
representation, and the choice was to hide words used only once in the case of italian tweets, and hide words used less than 8 times for english tweets
because they were many more. All the extracted metrics + details on the procedure can be found in the Maneskin Semantic Network - Modularity Analysis.zip
file. The main outcome of this analysis was the following: it appears that starting from the 2nd week and especially during the 3rd one, people's opinion
aligned and grouped because more different words were used but less communities are found. Modularity metric confirms it. This effect was found both in
the english tweets and the italian tweets, disappearing pretty quickly in the 4th week. Further confirmation is needed by using the results of sentiment
analysis, we need to understand if this shift in people's thought was positive or negative.

4. The hashtags network
Since it's impossible to build a network of users because we would have no means to link them (we don't have full conversations between users since we
only gathered tweets containing certain keywords), we thought of extracting hashtags and see whether they were more used in "positive" tweets or "negative" 
tweets week by week. (...)

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
Everyone should perform some kind of analyis on the results or comparison between the effects on the considered artists. This is because we have to
send a quite lengthy report (just go look at the example of past reports on Moodle) and we need to talk 5 minutes each during the presentation.
Each one of us needs something to talk about, so I thought of some analysis ideas:
- Someone should replicate the modularity analysis I did on Maneskin tweets for the other 5 artists and see if the effect is common. (Alex?)
- Someone could make graphs out of Edo's hashtag networks (... expand the idea) and analyse how these hashtags were used across the weeks (if more in a 
positive or negative way)
