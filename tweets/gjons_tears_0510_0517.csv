"@srfesc @SRF @Eurovision @gjonstearsoff @SRGSSR Please can you tell the delegation to change the staging? I want him to win, but his dance moves incredibly off-putting. Please change it before Wednesday!"
"This wraps up the @DeluluJury ranking for the meantime. Congratulations @gjonstearsoff for winning our ranking.  For the 39 participants taking part this year, we wish you all the best of luck."
@HelenMyers @gjonstearsoff I will listen in the morning. I was looking for a song to do with my Y8s this week. Mercy from a couple of years ago (French entry) is a good one too and sadly still relevant.
"A great entry from Switzerland for this Saturday's Eurovision with the amazing @gjonstearsoff. The volume is going to be way up high in my classes tomorrow! Link to page with gapfill, translation and video. Please tell me if you spot errors! #mfltwitterati https://t.co/h9o5CU7sA8"

"@srfesc @SRF @Eurovision @gjonstearsoff @SRGSSR ❤️🇨🇭Hey, open to some constructive criticism?  I love all the concept of Gjon's staging, vocals are PERFECT💙, emotional delivery is great, BUT as himself said, there still work to do: He needs to slow down the movements a little &amp; be less aggressive.
