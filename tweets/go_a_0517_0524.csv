For future reference I'm calling it - @_Go_A_  will be playing at major international dance music festivals in late 2021 / 2022  Cannot believe Eurovision introduced me to them. It’s been forever since I heard something like this.   #Go_A #Eurovision2021 #dancemusic
Can’t wait to finish it @_Go_A_
So proud of #Ukraine on #Eurovision2021 Their performance was so good omg. Great job #Go_A !!! https://t.co/ubslJv4ENy

#Go_A representing #ukraine in #Eurovision  was soooo fantastic! https://t.co/t8sDKYp8UA
@CabbageGrrl @_Go_A_ LOL you should have seen Smol literally throwing himself around the room to the Eurovision songs. I'll be surprised if he hasn't bruised his little arse 🤣
Thank you @_Go_A_ for providing us with the perfect spring incantation to dance around the bonfire. https://t.co/rpbcEY5NAm
@SynthAndStrings @_Go_A_ Obscure folk instruments / native language / dance beat is the way to go!  (I have not just killed myself trying to dance round the living room to this! 😳🤣 #TooOldForThisShitNow )
@CabbageGrrl @_Go_A_ God I would LOVE something in gaelic. And this is a fab track
@disarmonia @_Go_A_ LOOK AT THAT CAT 🥰
@_Go_A_ can someone help me? I think I love #SHUM so much.
@ObviouslyMoss @_Go_A_ My toddlers and I were raving to it as we were driving through the streets of Aberdeen today so here’s a solidarity fist bump 👊
Great feedback from @Telegraph 🇬🇧 #Ukraine #Eurovision2021 @_Go_A_ https://t.co/NaLrFcPmlA
@_Go_A_ You should have been 2nd! Not France! You’ll rock this summer! I’m sure! #Eurovision #Eurovision2021
@_Go_A_ no u! you're stole my heart
Been listening to @_Go_A_ all day
"I think I am quite late, but tonight insomnia has decided it:  I'm Team #Go_A in the #EUROVISION  With love also for Lithuania, Russia, Italy, and Germany.  I would love to love more the Icelandic team, for the visual, but sound-wise... meeh. https://t.co/dJqgH9auxP"
"@SynthAndStrings @_Go_A_ Same. Being Scottish/Irish and an ex-dancer, I love anything folky with a beat. We should send something like this to Eurovision next year!   https://t.co/MRrzqcebvJ"
@CabbageGrrl @_Go_A_ I think I remember this one. I love slavic folk-electronica. I know that sounds niche but its the combination of folk instruments and vocal technique with dance beats that really works for me 🤣
I can't get enough of this song  https://t.co/krefulPqIi #EUROVISION #Go_A
#Eurovision2021 #maneskin #Go_A  How it                       How it's  started                      going https://t.co/RPgFhNvjNH
"I absolutely MUST find myself listening to ""SHUM"" by @_Go_A_ and p*nging my nut off in a dark &amp; sweaty club at some stage this summer !!!"
"Me and my dad are listening to the Ukraine #Eurovision song Shum by @_Go_A_ in the car, we are OBSESSED"

@_Go_A_ @minnhinstidans Please come to Israel!
@_Go_A_ Can't wait! Saw you last year in Poland and it was one of the best live performances I saw! Can't wait to see you again!
In my moral podium there are certainly the @_Go_A_  #Eurovision  https://t.co/oScUIThXyT
#Eurovision2021 #Go_A were by far the best song of the night in my opinion. It was different and totally hypnotic to listen to. I have a new band to add to my list of favourites. However there was a lot of great acts last night.

@_Go_A_ Please come to the UK 🇬🇧❤️
"@disarmonia @_Go_A_ Agreed! It feels like we choose acts we think other people should vote for, rather than acts we would actually vote for ourselves. Which, sadly, sums us up quite well!"
@_Go_A_ you were my favourite!!!! I'm glad we won but I'm even happier that you were with us on the podium!!! can't wait to see you live ❤️❤️❤️❤️
"@GrimDarkThough1 @_Go_A_ Thank you.😌🖤 I think UK needs a bit of a rewamp tbh. Clearly plenty of peeps are watching, so British people do care, but something needs to change about the way the representatives are chosen."
"@_Go_A_ Yes keeping the Spirit of Slavic traditions alive, well done Ukraine."
"@disarmonia @_Go_A_ Here in the UK we have proven, time and time again, that sending easily digestible pop *doesn't work*! Ukraine's entry was nicely off-kilter and would have been a deserving winner!"
@mcgodwinpaccard @_Go_A_ I agree
@_Go_A_ THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERFORMANCE 🙏 🙏 🙏
@_Go_A_ Congratulations guys you were fantastic!
"Ukrainians suffer from so much horrible trauma, being treated like lesser for so long, our language laughed at, our amazing vibrant culture erased, diminished and appropriated throughout history.

"Absolute stars, @_Go_A_ have proven you don’t have to send easily digestible pop in english to do well and be loved by the #Eurovision audience. They’ve shown Ukrainian culture and language are beautiful and unique, despite us being told the opposite for ages by our neighbors.🥲"
"To wrap up the #Eurovision madness, gotta say a few things. So proud of @_Go_A_. They brought a song 100% in Ukrainian language, based on a pre-christian ritual, sang in traditional vocals with a mix of authentic ethnic sound and modern electronic music and they did SO WELL.🖤 https://t.co/2LU3h3owKg"

@_Go_A_ @solomonmax You were definitely No1 on this Eurovision (and I'd say it was the best song I've heard on this contest ever). But it would be too often for Ukraine to host Eurovision :) P. S.: jury voting is evident scam.

"@DarkGa2 @GerryGreek @_Go_A_ At that point I was actually shouting at the screen.

Zero points to #UK at @Eurovision is another #brexit sad story of #europeandivide. Happy for @thisismaneskin triumph🇮🇹🇪🇺! Love @_Go_A_ 🇺🇦 and @BMambaOfficial 🇵🇹!
@DarkGa2 @GerryGreek @_Go_A_ I’m very glad the talented but dull singers didn’t win. At one point on the recaps it felt a little bit like the Voice/X factor. I swear by all things I hold dear though...if Italy does not incorporate Ja Ja Ding Dong into proceedings I shall be most cross...😤

Final thoughts on tonight.. #SUI was ROBBED. They seem to have miscalculated #MLT's public votes (@destinymusicmt). Super proud of #UKR (@_Go_A_) who came 2nd in public vote. Well done to #ITA (@thisismaneskin).  Until next year #Eurovision ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

@deerpressed @_Go_A_ Yes please let us know if there is any way to buy it and support you!!
@AlexanderVelky @_Go_A_ @Eurovision What's so perverse is that the thing they are supposedly experts in is literally just 'knowing what the public will like' so they are a) unnecessary in the context of a public vote and b) demonstrably incompetent. They are self negating.

I'm also happy that Ukraine (@_Go_A_ ) got a great a result and made it to top 5! I'm so worried about them during the jury votes. The public votes never fails them!
"@LucyIsabel33 @_Go_A_ @uapbc I voted for them, unsure how I feel about winners"

Look at “Guardian of the woods” pattern by The Witchy Stitcher. It strongly reminds me of “Shum” by #Go_A .  1. “Shum” is a God of woods 2. Kateryna wears green fur  3.

"@JohanCr47470777 @Ukraine @_Go_A_ main point is only that you’re insulting a group’ song as if you could do better than them and it doesn’t sit right with me. and yes i was referring to the fact that they don’t sing in english: go_a sing in ukrainian and i love their song, that’s the only thing i care about."

Any gutter state that psychotically cant even get a representative for itself in 1 year, should not be promoting for any other year"

"@JohanCr47470777 @Ukraine @_Go_A_ i didn’t asked for your useless opinion, go cry somewhere else if you don’t like their song. i will still like it and i will continue support the group and the song, live with this."
"@sulynnie @Ukraine @_Go_A_ 1. The song is garbage 2. The native language of Ukraine is Russian - not some stupid dialect 3. What type of joke failed  country cant even produce a contestant for the previous year , in a country of over 20 million people, because they are all to connected to Russia?"
"@ripkevinroberts @Ukraine @_Go_A_ @Russia If you could kindly refrain from not being so dumb as to not know that ""Ukraine"" couldn't even produce a contestant for the last competition because ( in that failed Nazi state) all the possible singers were too Russian. Lol"

@_Go_A_ Congratulations – you have support from the UK!
Still thinking about @_Go_A_ and ‘Shum’ it’s the best song Ukraine have ever sent but having the song announced last in the qualifying results near brought on heart failure.   https://t.co/e1V6vkfRzN
Watching first semifinals of the @Eurovision – no doubt at all that #ukraine has the best song by far this year! Wow! Mesmerising and utterly brilliant! @uapbc @_Go_A_ #shum

"@hotmeils_ @uapbc @_Go_A_ Well the hosts could’ve announced them earlier, I’m sure they haven’t qualified from the 10th place, so let’s not talk about “robbing places”.  It’s just a random order of announcing 🤷🏻‍♀️ But it’s always easier when you find someone to blame huh?"
@actualmontaigne @_Go_A_ @dadimakesmusic Great song and performance. It felt super queer and I loved it. You got my vote. Got extra happy to see the trans flag. Sad that you didn't make it to the finals. Love from Sweden. 🇸🇪🏳️‍⚧️❤️🇦🇺
