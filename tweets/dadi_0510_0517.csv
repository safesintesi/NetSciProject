"@KrisWhoTweets @dadimakesmusic I am torn between  ""Why?"" and ""How?""..."
"Daði and Gagnamagnið go to Eurovision, take 2! It’s been 2 years since the last @Eurovision Song Contest. We think the world is ready for banging pop &amp; joyful celebration. We flew the Icelandic entry, @dadimakesmusic, to begin their campaign for victory! https://t.co/tw0r1IaQMw https://t.co/62w26YvHA2"
@dadimakesmusic was PERFECT! Looked 100% ready for the real show!
