"Watched the @Eurovision last night, and honestly for me, it had the best group of songs yet.  I’d say that @thisismaneskin and @BlindChannelFIN were probably my top two acts. Had both their songs stuck in my head all day. 🤘🏻"
"EN: in a world of people like the French, you have to be the Finns:  IT: in un mondo di persone come i francesi, dovete essere i finlandesi: #Maneskin #måneskin #BlindChannel #italy #Finland https://t.co/laH5FbAPKa"

"@CooperNicki23 @brightestgrizz @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN If his entry doesn't resonate with the audience then no, no votes for him.   Not sure why we're fixating on Ed though. Most of the entrants are not internationally known artists. They just brought their A game. UK did not."
#ESC #BlindChannel #Darkside  #Maneskin #zittiebuoni I love it! 😍
@katnappd @brightestgrizz @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Even if we sent Ed Sheeran no one would vote for GB 🤦🏻‍♀️
congratulations!!🖤 @BlindChannelFIN https://t.co/zPzI5HrTVc
@CooperNicki23 @brightestgrizz @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN The BEST song is subjective. People voted for who they wanted and liked best and that was not the UK this time.   Next year send a better entry or expect the same result.
@katnappd @brightestgrizz @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN No each country voted for their neighbouring country as per. Not the BEST song.
@cevansvaughan @frogail1 @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Thank god that we don’t all share your opinion in songs. It was totally crap. Not Eurovision worthy
Absolutely obsessed with @BlindChannelFIN after last night. SO good! 🤘🏻

Currently listening to @BlindChannelFIN on Spotify and yet to find a song I don't like
Just figured out @BlindChannelFIN &amp; @thisismaneskin both came to my hometown but I didn’t had a life back then 😭
I literally can’t with these two bands 🥺 #maneskin #BlindChannel #Eurovision https://t.co/iBWAMfFYZj
I think the BEST part of #Eurovision is all the amazing artists I never would have found otherwise.  Like @thisismaneskin @_Go_A_ #TheRoop @BlindChannelFIN @dadimakesmusic and so many others. I wish the absolute best futures to all who participated. 💜💜💜💜💜

@BlindChannelFIN  Fantastic https://t.co/T55XwHlpmH
"”Maneskin’s win with “Zitti E Buoni,” a song filled with off-color lines and lyrics about smoking, was not the only sign of a rock resurgence. Finland’s #BlindChannel came in sixth with an angry nu-metal song called “Dark Side” #euroviisut #Eurovision  https://t.co/eXmlvskx70"

@CooperNicki23 @brightestgrizz @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN In your opinion he's brilliant. In your opinion the Italian entry was rubbish. The public did not share your opinion and voted accordingly.

@BlindChannelFIN 's cover of Anastacia's Left Outside Alone has filled a void in my life that i never knew existed 🇫🇮 #EUROVISION https://t.co/xOQktLPq3L
@katnappd @brightestgrizz @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Yes it does. Me thinks it’s time for GB to stop wasting their time and stop entering. Even if Ed Shearing entered on our behalf (he is brilliant BTW) we would still get nil points
"@CooperNicki23 @frogail1 @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN It's not, the award is real and they won it."

Yeah Italy's song was good but why is no one talking about how good the Finland song was #EUROVISION #BlindChannel #mynewfavesong #DarkSide
"@TerryReintke @BlindChannelFIN We are very happy! Also, we should scrap the jury votes as they are also inclined to politics. Better to let people vote 100% the results.  As in European decision-making the directly elected European Parliament is often better than indirect ""juries"" called governments. ❤️👍"

@bellyncfc @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN And yet you struggle to get a single point from the audience.   You're pretty salty about something you think is so insignificant. Maybe take your bitterness elsewhere?
"@katnappd @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Certainly wouldn't,just shows how much effort is put into this rubbish tbh,when we have the alot of biggest music artists  in the world"

"@bellyncfc @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Considering the poor quality entries the UK has put forward for years, it wouldn't be a loss."
@bean6000 @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN I completely forgot about Iceland. Yes them too
"@katnappd @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Yes I totally agree,we should get out like we did the EU,let them fund it without our money"

"@bellyncfc @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Wow, so insignificant that UK pays its way in to the contest and you're here bitching about it. Must be hard."
If I could have a wish it'd be for @BlindChannelFIN to tour together with @thisismaneskin and @_Go_A_ . Man that would be epic. #Eurovision
"@katnappd @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Insignificant in the UK, always has been,its just a laugh at stupid mainland Europe,we ALL know which 2 countries produces the REAL World dominating music...USA &amp; UK"
"@F4D3X_ @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Iceland were really good though, and did even better considering the circumstances"
@bindibloodspot @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN those 0 points must really hurt

@bellyncfc @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN I'm absolutely not surprised the point keeps going over your head. Go enjoy your day with other things.
"@katnappd @cevansvaughan @brightestgrizz @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Well that makes sense...not,a bit like your last tweet tbh"
@CooperNicki23 @brightestgrizz @cevansvaughan @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN Their song wasn't good. Hope that helps ease the pain.

I think it's beautiful to see   @BlindChannelFIN celebrate the victory of @thisismaneskin because ROCK AND ROLL NEVER DIES and rock bands supports each others #Eurovision https://t.co/US7ZrY1hPx
"I just realized I knew @BlindChannelFIN since 2017! I remembered that there was something in my mind about the band but I didn't know that.  I heard the cover of ""Don't"" by Ed Sheeran from them in 2017 and I loved it. I always wanted to listen more to them. Well I'm doing it now"
Serious: The #ESC2021 Was the best #Eurovision Song Contest with 2 Bands beign something to remember and to follow after the contest. They raised the level of the contest and brought rock and metal back to it.  @BlindChannelFIN and @thisismaneskin I'm talking about you! #FIN #ITA
"Dude I haven’t gone full on fan girl mode in a looooong time, thanks @BlindChannelFIN for making me feel like a teenager again 😂 #Eurovision"
"Seriously @BlindChannelFIN are you going on a tour in 2022? And will you be in germany? Me and my friends REALLY want to see you, because we fuckin' love you!"

"Here's an idea for Oz tour promoters. Get #Eurovision winners @thisismaneskin 🇮🇹 and the even heavier 6th placed @BlindChannelFIN 🇫🇮 down here on a double bill. Hard rock was clearly IN with fans this year, and they'll surely be vaxed n ready to play. I'd definitely go."
@HlianaPas @BlindChannelFIN Great to hear that. Welcome to the dark side 🤗😀
"@BlindChannelFIN Congratulations on your great success at the ESC 2021 last night! Did you know that you got more votes than Lordi when they won in 2006 - 301 vs. 292? The voting system has changed since then, so you cannot directly compare these results. https://t.co/VQLvNC9TXh @MattiMyllyaho"

Hello #Sweden ✊ (knåck knåck)  In #Finland we've just decided that you guys may forget all kind of fighter deals without ANY #Eurovision points? Got it?   10-12 points = one fighter. Deal?   Ask any Finn. We all agree 🙌  #BlindChannel https://t.co/5mLQlkiMdE
Congrats @BlindChannelFIN for a great performance in #Eurovision 🔥🔥🔥
"#Finland #FIN #Eurovision Today - Got their highest all-time score (last was in 2006 with 292 points, new record of 301) - Their second best ESC result ever (also placed 6th in 1973 but there were only 17 participating countries, in 2014 placed 11th)  Proud of @BlindChannelFIN 🔥"

Finland's first time in the top 10 since Lordi's 2006 win! Before that we we're top 10 in 1989. #BlindChannel #Finland #Eurovision

Nice to see Italy win but it's basically royal blood in Italian so not 'heavy metal' as people keep saying. @BlindChannelFIN  were the real heavy act tonight. #Eurovision
Any idea why @BlindChannelFIN of Finland wasn't shown at all in the last part of #Eurovision at all? Even when they got a bunch of points? What happened..
PROUD TO BE FINNISH #BlindChannel #Eurovision

Switzerland should have won. Finland 6th. Second best achievement ever. ~(;^)~ Italy's song oldfashioned rock (and roll).  Congrats @BlindChannelFIN #Eurovision #OpenUp https://t.co/l65VOyZrZr
The fact we (UK) scored 0 points in #Eurovision this year I think sums up not only people's hatred towards us but also the fact that our acts havent been pro material.  Finland were by far my favourites. So kudos to @BlindChannelFIN for the incredible performance.
#Eurovision #FIN PROUD TO BE FINNISH @BLINDCHANNELFIN 💙🇫🇮

So #BlindChannel isn't allowed to throw a middle finger due to PG13 but Germany can have someone in a suit dressed a hand while throwing the finger? Really? #Eurovision2021
"Soon is time for #FIN, @BlindChannelFIN and #DarkSide! We cannot wait! #Eurovision"
