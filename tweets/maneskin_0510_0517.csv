"@gabi1569 @Jendrikkkk @thisismaneskin That is Jendrik, he is sooo kind!"
@IAmGrootjen @Jendrikkkk @thisismaneskin that blonde guy looks super cute 😩
I went to Rotterdam today and it was so awesome. The whole city is buzzing with the Eurovision vibe and I met @Jendrikkkk  and @thisismaneskin during the afternoon and many more artists during the turquoise carpet. Experiencing Eurovision in this way is such a dream come true! https://t.co/3ctlveo9xM

"@berettacubicu @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Because the running order can really have a huge impact on an artists chances of winning. Remember Czech Republic 🇨🇿 2019, finished 11th, Germany 🇩🇪 2019, #4, ended up with zero televotes. Positions between 1 to 9, likely hardly ever win."

"🗳 Following the second rehearsals of the #Eurovision 2021 automatic qualifiers on 15 May, our readers voted for who had the best one. The results are now in:  🥇 @thisismaneskin 🇮🇹 🥈 @Babpravi 🇫🇷 🥉 @JeanguMacrooy 🇳🇱  ✍️ via @JonathanVautrey  https://t.co/jrSdK2b33T"
"@Babpravi @thisismaneskin What’s going to happen next Saturday? I have no idea. It seems pretty wide open to me, but I’m almost never right in my predictions. As I fervently hope for every year, may the best song win. #Eurovision"
"@Babpravi @thisismaneskin Like I said, couldn’t be more different: either an ultra-emotional, super-French, old-school chanson, or a swaggering, in-your-face goth/glam rock song. But that’s the beauty of #Eurovision – there’s something for every taste, or for your own contradictory tastes."
"But after a list full of repeat performers, my top two are newcomers. I go back and forth on which one I like best – even though they’re maybe two of the most dissimilar songs of the year. Call them 1A and 1B for now:  #France (@Babpravi) and #Italy (@thisismaneskin). #Eurovision"

Even better - #Måneskin alone combined are 27 years younger than my two-piece band! How can they just be such bloody talented rock’n’roll sex gods at that age?! It’s incredible! #Eurovision
You want to know how young #Måneskin and #BlindChannel are? Combine the age of all ten members of the two bands together and it’s still a year or two less than the combined age of the four piece band I just had a practise with! Bloody fabulous! #Eurovision
@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin @smarkets @AlphaOliver_ I know right. Especially after destiny mesed up her staging.

If I was #France I’d actually prefer a draw as far away as possible from #Italy . Easier to define “my own space” at RO 10-13 than near Italy &amp; whichever big hitter comes in 2nd half. If Barbara placed close to #Maneskin there’s no question as to who will kill whom. #Eurovision

".@thisismaneskin are making full use of the width of the stage (are they the first ones to do so? We think they might be).  Elsewhere in their performance: shirtlessness and ""shiny, violet trousers"".  https://t.co/X7W1hLMQ17"

@Viggo06569031 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin 2 of them are not even founding countries. Without the 7 founders there would not even have been an ESC. Does 🇧🇪 🇳🇱🇨🇭(🇱🇺) get a wildcard as founding members?

@Eurovision @thisismaneskin The big 5 should not be protected. Some good songs do not get into the final because of their reserved spot.
