Okay now I really wanna see @BlindChannelFIN live
@jeremysnysg @thisismaneskin @BlindChannelFIN We need them to rock the Eurovision a bit.  Although Lordi's performance was iconic in my opinion.
Who else is really thinking that @thisismaneskin &amp; @BlindChannelFIN may give us a very rocky top 5 at #Eurovision?

@DuskTillDawnMcr @BlindChannelFIN Oh no. Finland are sending a rock band to represent again next week and they are quite good! They are in my top 10 for sure   https://t.co/npoqLMPkOF
@TheJodieeXO @BlindChannelFIN Oops need to pay more attention. Sorry I thought you meant the winners of 20 yrs or so ago
@DuskTillDawnMcr @BlindChannelFIN They are nothing like Lordii 😂 Two different style of rock
"Ok, Ok... Hear me out. Who has a rock side to them? You cannot tell me #Finland's entry is not amazing! Do love a bit of rock here and there ;) @BlindChannelFIN good luck boys! Go and SLAY souls #Eurovision #ESC2021"

"@SerbiaESC @Eurovision @BlindChannelFIN I really like Loco Loco, but daaaaym Sanja this is so good!! 😦🤘🏻"
You want to know how young #Måneskin and #BlindChannel are? Combine the age of all ten members of the two bands together and it’s still a year or two less than the combined age of the four piece band I just had a practise with! Bloody fabulous! #Eurovision
Like the 27 club headshot we dont wanna grow up ! #BlindChannel

"@wiwibloggs @BlindChannelFIN Some people think that it's a bit worse than 1st rehearsal. I obviously don't see any difference. I think the chaotism and blurriness from the pyro’s actually an advantage for the performance, as when in a rock concert, people usually love to see the mess and lightning everywhere"
