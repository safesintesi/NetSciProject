@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @JeanguMacrooy @JonathanVautrey So excited that Italy is currently bookies favourite!!!
#France🇫🇷 Second rehearsal clip now up!  What did you think? Check it out below✨  #Eurovision #Barbarapravi  https://t.co/NMswgsu7kr
@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @JeanguMacrooy @JonathanVautrey Wow we were third!
"🗳 Following the second rehearsals of the #Eurovision 2021 automatic qualifiers on 15 May, our readers voted for who had the best one. The results are now in:  🥇 @thisismaneskin 🇮🇹 🥈 @Babpravi 🇫🇷 🥉 @JeanguMacrooy 🇳🇱  ✍️ via @JonathanVautrey  https://t.co/jrSdK2b33T"
"@Babpravi @thisismaneskin What’s going to happen next Saturday? I have no idea. It seems pretty wide open to me, but I’m almost never right in my predictions. As I fervently hope for every year, may the best song win. #Eurovision"
"@Babpravi @thisismaneskin Like I said, couldn’t be more different: either an ultra-emotional, super-French, old-school chanson, or a swaggering, in-your-face goth/glam rock song. But that’s the beauty of #Eurovision – there’s something for every taste, or for your own contradictory tastes."
"But after a list full of repeat performers, my top two are newcomers. I go back and forth on which one I like best – even though they’re maybe two of the most dissimilar songs of the year. Call them 1A and 1B for now:  #France (@Babpravi) and #Italy (@thisismaneskin). #Eurovision"
"Did a #Eurovision 80s/90s evening w/ @leedsbradfordSF &amp; @chief_engi_Scot, and for voting, I did a what-if of post-Brexit Britain having a Yugoslavia 1981-style faux pas. Think I did more justice for @babpravi than for @ColinBerryradio. #EurovisionAgain https://t.co/HiK5uXDS44"
🇫🇷What a thrill on this 2nd day of rehearsal! Proud of my Dream Team France🔥and our @Babpravi  And a draw at the press conference that we are excited about #secondhalf🔥👊🏻🇫🇷 We remain focused and full of energy🙏🏻 🙌@Eurovision @Francetele @UMusicFrance https://t.co/CMKBDqH2F8

@Eurovision @Babpravi That’s her performing somewhere between 22-25 then
"@hoerebok_ @Eurovision @Babpravi THE J""EUIGH GET ME EVERYTIME"
@Eurovision @Babpravi Let her perform before Italy 😄
@doilookpeng @LucasHexagonian @Eurovision @Babpravi it is certainly not a slow song
"@mitchvanewijk @knabberfritz4 @LucasHexagonian @Eurovision @Babpravi that would be great but i try to keep my hopes down, maybe they will give it to a SF qualifier"

"@johnlm20 @LucasHexagonian @Eurovision @Babpravi I didn't know Non mi avete fatto niente was a ""banger"""
Yessss @Babpravi 2nd half ! QUEEN 👑
@Eurovision @Babpravi In my opinion this could benefit her alot!
@Eurovision @Babpravi Fuck yeah imho
"@Babpravi i call you barbaqueen since 1week, is it ok with you?"
"@johnlm20 @knabberfritz4 @LucasHexagonian @Eurovision @Babpravi I think 25 is also possible, because of the variation with the banger on 26 and previous favourites (Kristian Kostov, Eleni Foureira, Kate Miller-Heidke) also performing as 25th."
"Who is ready for my #Eurovision special on @wearegorgeousfm tomorrow from 10am ft. @Jendrikkkk, @Babpravi, @gjonstearsoff, @planetjedward, @ESCGREECE, @thisismaneskin, @KatrinasWeb, @Lenas_view, @Ani_Glass, @schultemusic, @IlseDeLange, #katrihelena, @imriziv @BlindChannelFIN +++ https://t.co/4E0q7T9UOS"
@Eurovision @Babpravi Oh this is gonna be a tense finish ahahaha
@knabberfritz4 @LucasHexagonian @Eurovision @Babpravi ah yeah forgot his place. ok then lets shift it to 19-22😅 or maybe 24 ? after Jeangu😉
@Eurovision @Babpravi I think it’s the first time for me I don’t care at all with having both JESC and ESC taking place in the same country/city in a row
"@actualmontaigne @Babpravi @SBSFRENCH @SBSEurovision Okay the French is impressive, sure, whatever, but the vocalssssssss https://t.co/qMhgDKFOHj"
"@LucasHexagonian @Eurovision @Babpravi not even, a banger is always at 26, I feel like it is going to be 20-23"
@Eurovision @Babpravi Germany is gonna get eaten😭
@dasdelfinorakel @Eurovision @Babpravi can you imagine haha
Voilá! @Babpravi from France will also perform in the 2nd half of the final!   #eurovision #songfestival #france #rotterdam #openup https://t.co/8kW88jf0zr

@mitsosboy @EurovisionF2 @Babpravi So for you it's disrespectful ? lmao
"@MickaelMuller69 @EurovisionF2 @Babpravi She was shady and disrespectful ! At the beginning, she even said ""should I watch all of it?""....😏"
@mitsosboy @EurovisionF2 @Babpravi I appreciate their bravoure
"@mitsosboy @EurovisionF2 @Babpravi She says : I will stop because it hurts my ears (not her type of song) but they are really brave, and I appreciate a lot"
"@mitsosboy @EurovisionF2 @Babpravi She just says that this is not her type of song, but she appreciates the originality and the fact that each artists take with them their universe, she wasn't disrepectful at all"
@ESCryptograph @Babpravi Right?! 🥰
