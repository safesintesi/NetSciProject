@dadimakesmusic @Darren_Rhodes Seeing you in Manchester next year . You have got to do City Lights .
@dadimakesmusic More London dates pleaseee 🙏
@kennykoalabear A little birdie (in the form of your human's sister) said you might be interested in my @dadimakesmusic tshirt... It was made by @StuffieStuff1!! https://t.co/mfV6agz6oE
"i wanted to make something for @dadimakesmusic music video, but i didn't manage because of the amount of the stuff i have to do for uni  rn i'm learning for a big test and one of the slides in the presentation is attacking me on personal level https://t.co/U0TIjoiCJg"
".@dadimakesmusic and Gagnamagnið, meet Lið Fjólublátt :) We went rogue until https://t.co/EIQGr1u5Ch can be replenished. Please make tee-shirts because it's currently 37°C here, but yes, we still want sweaters for when we have the best snow on earth. https://t.co/nQB776okPY"
@dadimakesmusic That’s good enough pal! Will watch for extra dates!
I would like to say tank you to @dadimakesmusic because through this video https://t.co/a4jacGYL70 I have discovered the super cool singer @MillieTurnr She has just release a new ep: Eye of the storm. It's great 😍
Casually went to buy some tickets to see Daði Freyr og gagnamagnið next June in Notts.... sold out. @dadimakesmusic more tickets please? 😁 https://t.co/D3iloFkDrk
@RichardWolfVI @Eurovision @dadimakesmusic So cute!! https://t.co/gGfuU8qUgi
"@dadimakesmusic already in! it seems like is such a beautiful, kind and respectful group, i love it 💞🥺"
@dadimakesmusic That's a big promise
@dadimakesmusic I'm not sure we will be able to make everyone's wildest dreams come true but we'll give it a good go. Thanks Daði. 🙏
"@dunclaurence Think about things or 10 Years by @dadimakesmusic, he already did a cover from Arcade that was amazing. Time to hear your version of his song!"
@dadimakesmusic Thanks @dadimakesmusic for promoting the fan group and wow 😮 so many new members joining 🤩🥰 . Welcome to all the new members that have just joined 🙂👋
@wintergatan and @dadimakesmusic ......... what wonderful music would that be....

"if anyone likes @dadimakesmusic, everything about you i like"
@dadimakesmusic Please @dadimakesmusic when I heard you on Eurovision I was like “OMG he is so good” and my second thought was that I’ll love to hear you with @jacobcollier you sound alike but so different and it would be amazing!!! Your music is on repeat in my house. Greetings från Sverige
@dadimakesmusic Embarrassed to admit I’d not heard of @jacobcollier ... but just checked out his tiny desk (home) concert and OMG! I love it!! And yes! Could be a brilliant collaboration 😀

@dadimakesmusic That song absolutely slaps
I wouldn't mind if iceland decided to send @dadimakesmusic every year to eurovision
@irg19 @dadimakesmusic My reaction after reading Daði recommending his song ‘Somebody Else Now’ (kalm) vs my reaction to reading your tweet and agreeing that it could be misinterpreted as ‘listen to somebody else’s music’ (panik). Lol. https://t.co/6nYCUd60tz
@dadimakesmusic You have no idea how many moments of love and joy you have made with your music in my daughter's and granddaughter's home during a raging pandemic in Texas! Thank you! My house will be always open to you. Mi casa es su casa. ❤️
