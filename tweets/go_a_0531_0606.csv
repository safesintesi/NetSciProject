I've been listening to @_Go_A_ 's album and so many of their tracks would fit the Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex soundtrack. No wonder I like them so much.

"@tasha_tsuman @_Go_A_ will they even dare to put Vidbir in a bigger venue (their Eurovision 2017 venue) and make the production slicker like Eurovision/Melodifestival? (plus scrap the jury comments, let them only present the points)"
Channelling some @_Go_A_ realness in game. What I need though is two dancers to make the set more convincing lol  #FFXIV #FF14 #GPOSERS https://t.co/NGnAqkO6uK
Watching MonoKate documentary was such a treat. Kateryna is a writer at heart and where she pulls her inspiration &amp; ideas from and how she weave them in creating music is magical. It transcends to the music @_Go_A_ puts out. Ukraine just got a band that will put them in the map.
