"@cla952 @JulienBch @Babpravi She did. She said she doesn't care, drugs or no drugs, she doesn't care more than if they had put their underwear the wrong way, 'cause they get the jury and the public votes, and that's what matters."

@JulienBch @Babpravi I don't know the names of the reporters. but barbara did not dissociate herself from the drug charge and represents france at the moment.

@TheWizardOfIce @_SpringY84 @Babpravi Don’t eat them - do you know how many calories is in one? It’s fucking obscene.
@DebStevo90 @_SpringY84 @Babpravi What you mean I have to shell out for a whole Greggs sausage roll?  You’re so high maintenance.
"@Babpravi. With a Italian surname I think it could be really hard for you... https://t.co/Mut9QpcLal you are third, war is ended in 1945 and Piath is already died, we don't need copies.   Voilà!"
"@ljubofil @Babpravi Be careful Ljubo, Petrit Selimi and Vlora Citaku might get angry at you because of this positive comment about Serbia and Serbs."
@_SpringY84 @TheWizardOfIce @Babpravi Knew you were always a wrong ‘un Spring.
"@TheWizardOfIce @_SpringY84 @Babpravi Gonna take a lot more than that, darling. Splash some cash, tight arse."
@DebStevo90 @_SpringY84 @Babpravi Yikes she’s properly got the hump this time.  Might have to throw in a DVD of MR along with the chocs to get back on her good side.
"@TheWizardOfIce @_SpringY84 @Babpravi Since you’re yet to deliver on that promise, I’ll take my chances actually, sod off 😹"
@EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi Don't let Orban defend his buddy Lukashenko tonight! Enough is enough! Treat Belarus like the european North Korea it is! #Belarus #жывебеларусь #Ryanair
@DebStevo90 @_SpringY84 @Babpravi I’ll be honest - things not looking that promising with the gorgeous Barbara.  Debs will have me back though. All her bold words are just bluster.  A tenner’s worth of Hotel Chocolat and she’ll be putty in my hands again.

"@Thyymelady @RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi Yes that was a bit of cringeworthy moment as well. Didn't top our Dutch Emma Wortelboer though, who brought hysterics up to a new level.. https://t.co/1xr8DvUrZG"

"@SarahMBishop1 @RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi Yeah, his reaction was superb! Better than that coming from your tabloids."
"@RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi In terms of my favorites it was a close call between Switzerland, Iceland and France.  And Mandy 'it's all gibberish to me' Holden WAS painful and embarrassing to watch. Even more so than Germany."
@srbtmylmdemi @Babpravi @hurricane_srb @thisismaneskin @SpotifyCares when will we got chart for Serbia? 🥰
@MatteoDettori5 @RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi I kind of fancied him. Even though I think he's a bit of an arrogant git.

@Babpravi's reaction to the post #Eurovision drama is world-class. ❤️ #BarbaraPravi https://t.co/EB5q427npX
"Now, normally, I don't pay much attention to the Eurovision song contest, but this song by @Babpravi has certainly piqued my interest. Minimalist, yet quite dramatic. https://t.co/uCjPCtWQ4o"
"@RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi Not watched it for years,  miss Terry Wogan’s comments - brother says Graham Norton was very good. I actually went to a live concert in London. So good to be inside a concert Hall again. Theatre tonight ….. so happy."

@Babpravi @kthejutokes I’m Dutch and honestly wondering why they thought they would just give you strawberry’s on a sandwich 😫
@Babpravi @kthejutokes The question is... was it nice? XD I might try 😂

"@magia313 @EurovisionF2 @Babpravi Why u cry here? You think all French are salty about Italy? We don't care we saw he don't take drugs and it's a fair win, so don't come in French media's cry for nothing, this place is for thanks Barbara for her 2nd place! Have some respect here thanks."

@EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi Macron and some politician bride by USA stupid enough fall on biden traps against Europe china trading agreements which hurt Europe own benefits. Macron rather  bow to biden administration. Shameful to your people macron. Jesus christ
