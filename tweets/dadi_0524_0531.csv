"@EurovisionSpot @dadimakesmusic No, the Winner are Maneskin, not Damiano David. All Four or nothing."
@Icelandair @Eurovision @dadimakesmusic You are an unethical airline. I used credit from a flight you cancelled last year to rebook. I am due to fly to my terminally ill father in 2 weeks. You cancelled my flight without telling me. You will not rebook me. I am told there are no flights! I see you advertising flights !

#Bhopal #Verified We rcvd 10K for 71 yr old widow #Dadi Sakeela bee. Need 3K more to close the fundraiser. Husband and only son died long back.  She is struggling for her livelihood. Her 3 months room rent and grocery bill is due.  https://t.co/Rwge1VvTwx https://t.co/i1WU6ySouH

@beth_browner @dadimakesmusic Ok I'm gonna need you to sustain this level of excitement for a year can you do that?
"My daughter spent a lot of today practicing the @dadimakesmusic dance from ""10 Years"". These steps are almost as helpful as she is cute. Almost. https://t.co/QJPCgVOLHo"
@dadimakesmusic So hype!

"Yes, I just spent 20 minutes trying to learn the dance to #10Years at Midnight. No, I am not ashamed. @dadimakesmusic"

@dadimakesmusic I'm there!
"If you enjoyed @dadimakesmusic and their giant robot with sweet sweet moves, here's how they made the costumes!  https://t.co/Pxe1bOB21k"
@dadimakesmusic Are you planning to add more dates in the UK? Tickets sold out so fast 🥺
"My wife and I feeling inspired by @dadimakesmusic's Eurovision song, 10 Years. Spent WAY too long practicing, but we have no regrets. 💃🕺 https://t.co/PdHsUCwHYz"
@dadimakesmusic I was ready for this!! https://t.co/p0PEaGOkUQ

@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision But we love Dadi Freyr and his show will be pure magic ✨✨✨
"@KristaSiegfrids is such a star. These Eurovision Song Celebration episodes are amazing with her ""hosting."" Especially loved the dance bit with Iceland's @dadimakesmusic"

Current mood: regretting not getting @dadimakesmusic tickets 🥺
@dadimakesmusic Discovered you two days after Chicago sold out. Can you invent me a time machine? Or maybe come to Detroit? We're really quite pleasant people!
@dadimakesmusic I hope you like the creations I submitted.😉😉😉
Add a date in Cardiff challenge @dadimakesmusic
"Thx @dadimakesmusic, I can dance now #Eurovision #Eurovision2021 #EurovisionSongCelebration"
I'm so glad @dadimakesmusic got to Rotterdam &amp; got their rehearsals in - he's always brilliant but the LED screens were brilliant in the Ahoy #Eurovision
@dadimakesmusic You are amazing! Tracks on a loop ever since Eurovision. 👏👏👏
@ESCunited @dadimakesmusic The LED really added a lot here as well
Also this reminds me I need to buy my sweater from @dadimakesmusic. #EurovisionSongCelebration  #Eurovision  -Connor
@dadimakesmusic Got tickets with my friends and were sooo excited! Can't wait!
"@AlanRanker @dadimakesmusic i know, and i hope that doesn't happen but people should still do their research before buying  tickets for anything if theyre gonna be disappointed."
@dadimakesmusic @missfirthmusic @MrsFergusonMus1 you know we should!!!!
"@dadimakesmusic If my tiny Shih Tzu legs could do it, I'd love to throw some shapes for you. Damn my genes."
@dadimakesmusic Oh my gosh! Yes!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Constantly nagging @dadimakesmusic to play Jaja Ding Dong has the same energy as nagging @electric6 to play Gay Bar. How about you actually stop and enjoy their music instead of continuously annoy them.
@dadimakesmusic @PavelSebbie hey dadi did you get my video??
Mum: Tori what are you doing? Me:  @dadimakesmusic https://t.co/6TGs9OvTlE
@dadimakesmusic what social media will you be posting the video on?
@dadimakesmusic i recorded it and sent it i have my fingers crossed (:
@dadimakesmusic very important question do you have a crash bandicoot tattoo? Asking for a friend who is me and my brother
@dadimakesmusic @Harriclare92 your time to shine again
@AlissonReenan @dadimakesmusic Oh my god
@dadimakesmusic It’s SO GOOD. I love Chromeo so it’s no surprise I love your music too!!!! The remix was such a great surprise! Do you think you’ll cover a Chromeo song?
@dadimakesmusic @Icyhunt LETS GO
@claudandersonx @dadimakesmusic Bruh stop
@dadimakesmusic Its like people don't follow your YouTube channel.  First and last time and we can listen to it endlessly on YouTube.
@dadimakesmusic Oh my five year old would LOVE this as he adores this song. Will get him to do a dance
"@euro_kip @dadimakesmusic A load of people turning up and being disgruntled about not seeing what they expected to see does not, normally, make for an enjoyable gig!"
@dadimakesmusic This is Betsy Pearl. She was in the 10 Years choir (as was I). She’s now practicing to get in the video. Watch this space! https://t.co/OOTBYEKnW8
@dadimakesmusic I have send pictures and a short clip of your dance 😂😇
@dadimakesmusic @AceTrainerLisa LETS GO
@Justnick752 @dadimakesmusic DOGGING 😂😂😂 YES!!
"@dadimakesmusic Great idea! My daughter's love's this dance. Videos uploaded already! If you need a backing dancer for your tour, just ask!"
@dadimakesmusic @monranomar She loves the Monster! Thank you for your music! https://t.co/lDMi2cNMdV
@dadimakesmusic @helen_schopp Isobel would absolutely love this!
@dadimakesmusic I’m trying desperately to convince my 12 year old to join in with me and my 11 year old. 🤞🤣
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Dadi is the cake. The whole cake, not just a slice. Gagnamagnid are the cherry on top. Go look at his solo stuff on YouTube, which is just awesome...then anyone who has tour tickets won’t worry about the cherry. 😊"
@dadimakesmusic I'm gonna find some aliens🤔
@dadimakesmusic does the fan art have to be of something from 10 Years specifically?
@dadimakesmusic gonna put my dancing shoes on i guess
@dadimakesmusic Thank you!
@dadimakesmusic when's the deadline 👀👀
"@dadimakesmusic Dadi, important question: what's the deadline? 🥺"
@dadimakesmusic omg yes! Love this idea!! Definitely getting involved! What’s the deadline??
I can't stop listening to @dadimakesmusic. The tone of his voice is just mesmerising and I'm working my way through his YouTube covers now. Why are the UK dates sold out for next year 😭
"Tickets for 1/4 @dadimakesmusic show’s arrived today, it’s finally feeling really that concerts will be a thing again https://t.co/Gfq640S9AH"
All I wanted to do was see @dadimakesmusic in Chicago but it’s already sold out fml 😭😭
@dadimakesmusic My almost 4 year old wants to know what the monster’s name is (from the 10 Years video). She’s very insistent that it has a name.
@dadimakesmusic the most important question of all WILL YOU DO THE DANCES
@dadimakesmusic  Your EP 'Welcome' is absolutely gold. The music is so soothing! Absolutely can't stop listening ❤
"@dadimakesmusic @Chromeo I've loved Chromeo for years, I was over the moon when I saw they did a remix."
"@dadimakesmusic @Chromeo Well now I wanna hear a cover of either ""Fancy Footwork"" or ""Jealous (I Ain't With It)""... or both? 🤔"
@dadimakesmusic I’ve been listening to 10 Years and Think About Things on a loop for a week. So damn good.

"Tickets arrived in the post this morning for @dadimakesmusic at the O2 Acadeny in November. Feels like normality is returning. Ev'rything about it, I like."
"@dadimakesmusic We know, but still, would be nice to see them dancing"
@dadimakesmusic Clearly you need to get a couple of iPads with their faces on so they can be your backing singers 🤣  It’d totally work https://t.co/3mi9b6jLv8
@dadimakesmusic @Chromeo it’s what you deserve!! love the song and the remix 🕺🏼
@dadimakesmusic @Chromeo 😱That's awesome!🤩
#Urgent #Verified We are raising funds for 71 yr old widow #Dadi Sakeela bi. Husband and only son died long back. Neighbours are helping by providing cooked food.

@DaraVelour @dadimakesmusic dw I won’t🤣🤣 just a joke

"@dadimakesmusic Daði I had a dream (not a daydream, an actual asleep dream) that you added Seattle to your tour &amp; announced it on Twitter. It was so real that now, hours later I came back to check if it really happened 🥺🙏  (that’s what I get for falling asleep to you on repeat) https://t.co/MsULUb2c80"
Just accidentally discovered that the musical stylings of @dadimakesmusic and the voice of Jean Luc Picard (@SirPatStew) in TNG are a match made in heaven.
@dadimakesmusic Awesome! I'll be waiting for the Amsterdam show (im)patiently!
@dadimakesmusic the only man i ever respected
@_girl_afraid_ @dadimakesmusic I mean it's hard not to
@dadimakesmusic Fuck yes I love you
"@dadimakesmusic You see, in this world there's two kinds of people : those who love you and your songs and those who want you to play ja ja ding dong..."
@dadimakesmusic 🤙🏼 we got it. Now it seems like a flex.
"@dadimakesmusic Nooo, please don't torture me! That's one of my favorites (along with Takk) and I can't get tickets because Los Angeles and San Francisco are sold out 😭 Would you be willing to go to Portland or Seattle and add another tour date?? I would be eternally grateful 💚💙"
@dadimakesmusic What about Japan? 😻
@dadimakesmusic Your loss buddy.
@dadimakesmusic can I make a sincere request that you do “save all your kisses for me” in new york?

IMO @dadimakesmusic  from #Iceland had the best performance at #Eurovision   https://t.co/zBDAcNGkzS https://t.co/n8zL3DNRyh
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Tough choice but I agree with others - Somebody Else Now needs a big production behind it. Therefore my vote goes to Clear My Head.  What I really want though is the 10 Years Chromeo Remix. A home video for that would be awesome!

". @dadimakesmusic just thought you should know that my 1 year old goddaughter is your actual biggest fan. Sometimes your music is the only thing that'll calm her down and, for that, we thank you ❤️ keep up the good work! https://t.co/GAff1mDvoa"
May allah gives us strength to overcome the grief of losing our loved one. #Dadi
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision You're gonna need a bigger band... https://t.co/sTFw3af4Zj
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Why not just become Santa and come together every Christmas? 👍
"@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Both! But most importantly, hope you're both safe and stay well. Sending positive vibes! 💚"
@dadimakesmusic Well deserved ❤
@fromverotohero @Schubes17 @dadimakesmusic That’s gonna be an interesting one for sure ahahha
"@FlavianSophist @dadimakesmusic A lot of UK and Europe stops, NY, Chicago, and LA, all in 2022. I think a lot of the stops sold out though. Chicago was changed to Lincoln Hall from Schubas to accommodate how fast tickets were going! https://t.co/WBKjqqCg6Q"
@dadimakesmusic Please add more US dates!! I'd love to see you in Seattle or Portland!!!
@distairify @dadimakesmusic Where are they touring?????
"Hot damn the new @dadimakesmusic slaps so hard. You need to listen to him. Like now. Go, I will wait here...."
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola It was so great. Stay safe you two!
@ThatInterested @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision That would be awesome!
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Eurovision Santa is the best thing I've heard in my goddamn life! And also very true. You were truly a brilliant part of this year, and I will never forget it"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Your tour band is just as awesome as Gagnamagnið!
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision So you are Huldufólk. Is that supposed to make me believe that you aren’t real or my favorite band?   NOPE.   I believe! I will knit you little hats! Make cookies in your image and cry as I eat them!   You have my heart. Don’t go breaking it.
Tickets booked for me and @JamesABrightman to see @dadimakesmusic  next year 👌😎can't wait :D
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision But hulda and sigrun have lovely voices :((
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @Jendrikkkk you already got 4th place too!! You both are AWESOME!!
"@dadimakesmusic Legendary, you gotta do another livestream and sing cover those are so fun"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Does that mean we get to see Santa next eurovision again? 🥺
@Hagknight @jbtutIII @dadimakesmusic So much special 🌈✨
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Gutted I missed out on Chicago tickets already.
"@glasswatt @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Stefán and Jóhann aren't even musicians, Daði just asked them to join them on stage in 2017 because they wanted to have 6 people on stage since that's the maximum"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision That’s what Spinal Tap thought 😉
@glasswatt @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Maybe some of Gagnamagnið don't want to do it full time.
"@omalonar @SerahKoruya @dadimakesmusic Meanwhile in Spain: ""we just want ONE date :("""
@GirlsOwn Phew! I'm exhausted from knitting all those jumpers for Iceland's entrant to #Eurovision2021 #dadifreyr #GirlsOwnCC
@LincolnHall when will the extra tickets be released for @dadimakesmusic?
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Where can we find the sweatshirts? I need one 🙇🏻‍♂️
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Don't tell me this. You're touring in the UK, therefore you're a band."
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Still loads of love but I think you should bring them all with you 😂
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Who is Petar and Ylva?

"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision If I keep clapping, will that keep Gagnamagnið in existence? 👏"
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Well, I hope you participate in as many Eurovision contests as possible then.  Not that I didn't before learning that"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Add a stop in Madison WI 😭by the time I realized Chicago was listed it was sold out

@sickpub @SerahKoruya @dadimakesmusic fraid so
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Obvious to anyone who’s ever seen your home concerts but you’re probably right to point it out! 2022 is too far off, I’m so excited to come and see you in LA!"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Why not become a real band though?
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Will you tour in Australia at some point in the future?
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision I BELIEVE!!!! https://t.co/380xnNMRi0
@omalonar @SerahKoruya @dadimakesmusic did glasgow sell out?
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision I'm pretty sure you're a team of superheroes who defeat giant monsters with your sweet sweet dance moves. 😤 https://t.co/KUHA87NCAl
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision But...Eurovision *IS* Christmas...
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision add another london date challenge
@SerahKoruya @dadimakesmusic i mean if you're asking for extra london lemme just ask for extra glasgow
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Exactly this!
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision one day i will not have no money... and then i can finally see you perform
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision You’re real to me damn it
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision If you wanted to add another london date I wouldn’t be opposed 😏😌
@dadimakesmusic What a beautiful music do you make. I have seen your performance at the Eurovision contest. It was a pitty i couldn't see you live. Btw your previous EVC-song was also great. Thanks for your musical creativity. Till next time in Holland (Nijmegen).
@ITHERETWEETER1 @AllAgainst_band @mattthepeach @eclipsesweden @NettaLaurenne @MolyBaron @THEDAMNTRUTH1 @_wearesuspects @colettamusic @MojoAlice @dadimakesmusic @WormwoodSWE @lockyerboys @TeddyFontana @R_AshcroftMusic Thank you for the music love 💗
@dadimakesmusic Should have been 1st!! The judging panel is so out of touch with the public!! You’re the real winners!
@dadimakesmusic Just been gifted three tickets to come to your show in London with my family. We are big fans and my son is so excited 👌👌
@TheShortBastard @dadimakesmusic We don't deserve you tbh
@dadimakesmusic Thank YOU!
"@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola I’m new here. Loved “Think About Things”, but don’t know the other songs. Link to the EP, please? Happy to pay to download"
"Iceland should've definitely won Eurovision, @dadimakesmusic is so good"
@pachidermi @dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Does Spotify only have a Top 50? I'm confused now
@dadimakesmusic Huge fan here from Australia 💕
@dadimakesmusic https://t.co/kP26OceFV9 thank you for this masterpiece
@dadimakesmusic Where can I find your sweatshirt? I need it 🥲🥲
"@dadimakesmusic Congratulations, happy to say I'm one of them 😁."
@dadimakesmusic Your music is literally so gokd you deserve it
@dadimakesmusic thanks for your lovely song! Makes us so happy! Woke up on Sunday with your song in my head. Today my husband and I are 40 yrs together and married for 20 yrs. We watched your videos on Youtube ánd the making of the masks. Somuchfun! Hope to see you live one day🤗
@dadimakesmusic I just discovered your music and honestly it feels like a hidden treasure😭😭 You deserve so much more
@dadimakesmusic Each one deserved! &lt;3
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola You should make music videos for both of these songs
@dadimakesmusic Congratulations!! You fully deserve it 💗
Stunning !  @dadimakesmusic   https://t.co/KHhas1HKtv
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Clear my head feels like it's both perfect for your current state and for the more low-fi feel it has relative to Somebody Else Now imo but I will eat up whatever you do 💖
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Somebody else now a masterpiece
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Clear My Head would be perfect for a video with the two of you! and then a full production video for Somebody Else Now maybe? Please? If you want? 😊
"@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola but seriously, Clear My Head is more suited for a subtle video and Somebody Else Now needs a bigger project or you can just play to the cows again"
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola BOTH
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Oh I love the bass in Clear My Head.  If you are in the mood for a cover I'd love to hear your interpretation of Hot Chocolate's Every 1's a Winner.
@dadimakesmusic love your #thinkaboutaliens game!!
There are few examples of romantic storytelling as beautiful as the @dadimakesmusic Eurovision trilogy of songs - The thrill of new love - The wonders of parenthood - The joy of a strong long-term relationship
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola voting clear my head only cause i'm hoping for a big production for somebody else now 😌
This is one of the few sponsored messages on Instagram that I don't mind.  @dadimakesmusic https://t.co/MWOMxzFZcq

Honored to have been a part of a song that came in the top five at #Eurovision this year! Thank you @dadimakesmusic for giving us all the opportunity to be a part of this wonderful song! https://t.co/ovzZapLETl
You couldn’t convince me that @dadimakesmusic wouldn’t have won last year.
@elif_bxl @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic @HooverphonicOff Yes! Absolutely! Can’t believe they didn’t make it to top 5!
"@nashtysmans @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic I'm pretty much content with the results. I don't think I'd ever listen to the songs of UK, Germany or NL. Only Belgium deserved better! @HooverphonicOff was great."
@elif_bxl @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic I really thought she would win! It was such a good show. Wanted more love for the Netherlands and Germany though. Also poor UK.
"@nashtysmans @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic Thanks to Barbara, I am motivated to study French 😅"
"Call me crazy, but I’d give anything to see @billieeilish and @dadimakesmusic collab to make a funky europop tune"
@goalissoul @dadimakesmusic *coughs*
So glad I actually bothered to watch Eurovision this year.  @dadimakesmusic  is possibly the best thing to come out of ESF in two decades.
"Tha livestream of #dadifreyr is everything XD I love his humor so much. ""If you left during this song, you can come back now. Or not. You do you."" XD"
@elif_bxl @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic Love them all so so so much! &lt;3
"@dadimakesmusic It's very, very good. I bought it and love it.   If you release it on vinyl, I'll just have to go and buy the dang thing all over again. 🙃"

It’s only been 2 days since the Eurovision Grand Finals aired and @dadimakesmusic has already planned a tour for June 2022. Hilarious!
@dadimakesmusic You have a family who loves your music.  Husband and I are booked to see you in June next year.  Learning the dances already
Gutted for @dadimakesmusic that they didn't get to perform live. Here's to hoping @Eurovision let them perform next year even if just part of the entertainment as opposed to entrants.  #Eurovision #Eurovision2022   https://t.co/6AouQeTTRh

@danielthomasnw @dadimakesmusic @senhitofficial Oh yeah VICTORIA for sure for me too.
