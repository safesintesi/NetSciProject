"@tasha_tsuman @_Go_A_ Shouldn't he give that money to Go A and their selected organizations, academy etc? That should also help promote the band internationally."
@tasha_tsuman @narobyly_shuma @_Go_A_ Hope 😶
@GO_A_STAN @narobyly_shuma @_Go_A_ let's hope they will add translation for YouTube stream next year 😉

"@GO_A_STAN @narobyly_shuma @_Go_A_ well, they been asked for Eng. translation for years, so maybe finally they will do it knowing how many people out there watching Vidbir live shows"
@tasha_tsuman @narobyly_shuma @_Go_A_ What English translation.. Yessssssss
"@narobyly_shuma @_Go_A_ yup, there are speculations about new stage and English translation for live shows"

"@_Go_A_ @NatureGatherer To give you an idea an idea how culturally important SHUM is, the only comparison I can make is to our own Go_A : Yothu Yindi.  Dr Yunupingu sadly died in 2017.  https://t.co/MhquWogytG"
being at work would be easier if I could listen to SHUM by @_Go_A_ on repeat ❤

@chartdata @_Go_A_ Thanks from Ukraine for your support!
@dua_minaj @escsunal @jisootherabbit0 @chartdata @_Go_A_ And nobody makes you listen them - so the fact that you don't know them doesn't upset us and Go A as well. I don't just understand why you have left your useless comment under this twit.
