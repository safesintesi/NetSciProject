"@KSeregni @wiwibloggs So shame on the EBU to let this stupid controversy to continue and expose Måneskin like this.   Imagine the first question for @Babpravi (when she came back to France after best results since 30 years) was ""what do you think about the controversy"" ..."

This is definitely not stalking.  And no matter how fit she is the @_SpringY84 patented ‘24hr follow back rule’ still applies.  No follow back within that time and you’re unfollowed and we’re over @Babpravi.    And I guess I go crawling back to @DebStevo90. https://t.co/dCjgl2GnEd

@RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi My highlight was James Newman's wholehearted embracing of scoring no points at all. What a legend.  I didn't care for the winning song; for good Eurovision rock I would go back to Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah  - I loved that. We should get Queen with Adam Lambert to represent us.
@JuditKiss18 @RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi Lovely 💕😊.
@Babpravi @CapitolFR @EurovisionF2 You are a very good singer and I will start to follow you from today. But I am very sorry that a France journal said bad things about @thisismaneskin and said that Damiano uses cocaine. It is very unfair. https://t.co/KkZdDkGqgj

@Babpravi You deserved without a doubt the number 1 spot. Fantastic performance! France won in my opinion.

"@EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi Terrorist Lukashenko ordered KGB officers to report that the plane in which Roman Protasevich, editor of the opposition channel Nexta, was flying, was mined, after which the plane landed in Minsk, and Protasevich sentenced to death.

@Babpravi You are one of my favorite singers with so much talent and charm. I wish you all the best from China! I hope you can win this contest! Good luck!
"@Babpravi I don't know much French, but you were amazing and had my vote! The very best of luck in the future!"

@Babpravi a star is born #Eurovision https://t.co/zfjqCf44dG
"@Eurovision What an amazing artist, wonderful song; sung passionately and straight from the heart. Should have won!  #Voilà #France @Babpravi"
Must say how much I was affected by what @BabPravi said after jury scores on @Eurovision.  Her mention of both top songs (at that time) being in French was the only overtly political statement of the night. I almost wish I hadn't voted for France. #Eurovision #Eurovision2021
@albeauvaischiva @Eurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @EurovisionF2 i don't talk https://t.co/q4UCx8ozId

What a beautiful song #BarbaraPravi https://t.co/egL4Bc4jla
@Babpravi My favorite. I voted you with a message phone from Spain 💕
@ConflitsFrance @Babpravi @VidalFrederique First
"@8354_collot @MarianaGrepinet @GroseilleJlouis @ParisMatch @Babpravi Hahaha such bad loosers. In france music is all about “sublime” ladies and people masturbating over it. It’s not anymore about contestation, reaction, about young people wanting to change the world... the lyrics of the Italian band are significant to everyone."
@kthejutokes @Babpravi Where can I get one?
"@EurovisionF2 @Babpravi @France2tv Perfect, I are the best"
@EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi Guignol
@6Juste @EurovisionF2 @Eurovision @Babpravi Belin se ve rode oh.
"We need @tommcrae for UK's #Eurovision2022 entry. Already has a following in Europe (+cousins in Australia for votes), music style not unlike France's @Babpravi, and the vocal range of Switzerland's @gjonstearsoff. Dad dance moves and onesie merch like @dadimakesmusic optional."
"Ok, to restore peace among EU countries, I propose this @Eurovision video with reactions to the past editions:  @thisismaneskin react to @MetaErmal and @FabrizioMoroOff ""Non mi avete fatto niente"", and also @Babpravi admits ""I love Italia""  💖  https://t.co/dUJJCfOGQ9"
"@Babpravi sung absolutely beautifullyast night and with the upmost passion, single handedly the absolute best song I've ever heard in my lifetime ❤️."
#BarbaraPravi owns my heart https://t.co/rSHYtUchR9
"Let me, guess...Italy had massive support of one of social portals🤔 Still, #BarbaraPravi was the only one being appreciated both by jurors and public🔥 Wasn't too tired to watch her😍 So emotional, couldn't have been more. France on the plate. Perfect👌 Cried myself yesterday."
@ESCShowcase @ForestFM @CiaranUT @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic @gjonstearsoff Will definitely be tuning in. The UK needs to rethink it's strategy.  This year we had lazy staging (what worked for Michael Ball in 1992 won't work 30 years later) and we are relying on the glory days of the late 1970s. James did the best he could with a challenging situation.
"@FranckMollier1 @gillesverdez @Babpravi The video is not ambiguous? Did you watch it? Because you are right, it is not, but it clearly shows a boy cheering for the ranking."

@Babpravi it would be nice and the CLASSY thing to do if you could tell your fans and french Twitter in general to chill and stop defaming the Italian singer just because they are bitter you lost. You still got the best result France got in a while. All of this is childish
@EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi Connard !
"@Babpravi Well done last night I think you should have been the winner your song and performance were so good, you had no gimmicks, flashy effects or support it was just you and the power of your performance. Excellent 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"

In 1646 the 13 year old Italian boy Giovanni Battista Lulli came to France. Under his gallicized name Jean Baptiste Lully he became the father of French Opera. Judging by her name @Babpravi must have Italian roots as well. Una doppia vittoria per l’Italia! 😁#Eurovision https://t.co/wBcFyPu2V3

@I_am_Negan_69 @kevinjaybe @EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi So right ! This person probably doesn’t speak or hear a word of English 🤨 So easy to criticise...😣
"@YanniKouts @Babpravi So close, so close.  Love Barbara Pravi."
@FloraMoussy @Babpravi De justesse domage
@Babpravi proved that you don't need flashy costumes or high-tech staging or generous neighbors to do well at #Eurovision. A song from the heart is enough.
@YanniKouts @Babpravi My winner.

@Elane67000 @Tof_Beaugrand @Babpravi Remember 2006

@kevinjaybe @EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi French is an official language of Eurovision so what's your point ?
@MaximeGueny @benjaminrabier @Babpravi BENNY B
"@AnonumusD @EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi I’m not embarrassed, we didn’t really expect much , but it was a travesty that France didn’t win wonderful song beautifully sung."
@_DanielleMoreau @Babpravi 👍👍Idem
@ahsennhasan @Babpravi im so happy for mu country but france deserved too!!
"@kevinjaybe @EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi So what ? Just so you know, English is not the only language in Europe. Almost each country said something in their language."
At least France was top 3 this year! Really proud of #BarbaraPravi #Eurovision
@kevinjaybe @EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi French is one of the official language of eurovision... Check your brain before writing stupids fils de pute
How this didn’t win I’ll never understand but I reckon they’ll be singing this song in French clubs in a century. Brilliant! #BarbaraPravi #Voilà #Eurovision  https://t.co/JLVzCAlM1O
"Hey look at that, for once we didn't do so bad! Ty @Babpravi for this second place and huge congrats to the Italian band @thisismaneskin for their win! (Their aesthetic was so close to the one from our 2000s musical ""Mozart l'Opera Rock"", I can't be mad lmao 🔥) #Eurovision"

@AurelieRG @Babpravi Anyway we opened champagne for @Babpravi!
@kevinjaybe @EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi Official language of Eurovision is French ... So 30 seconds in french as a little reminder of this fact should not be too difficult to bear... Assuming that the difference between you and us is that we also speak english .
"@kevinjaybe @EmmanuelMacron @Babpravi She did said "" 12 points goes to..."" why ypu so mad abt love?"
"@Babpravi oohh, sorry! You will be always my winner!"

@Eurovision @Babpravi We're spitting our dummy out for next year and not paying towards Eurovision if we get no points
I think we’d all like to know France’s @Babpravi ‘s skin care routine #Eurovision2021 #esf21 #FRA
@Eurovision @Babpravi She looks like a young Winona Ryder
@Eurovision @Babpravi UK need to exit the Eurovision !!!!!!
@Eurovision @Babpravi We got Iranian and other Islamists  supporters in Europe manipulating Jewry against European states and Israel. The very account is an Islamist run account. Fake!!
@Eurovision @Babpravi Beyond ridiculous that the UK hardly ever gets points from the judges anymore. Not all the songs of the last 10 years or whatever have been bad enough to be in the bottom 5. Time for home voters only.
My 12 points vote from Brussels goes to Fraaaaaaaance ! &lt;3 #Eurovision #belgium #France #BarbaraPravi

@GJustjuve @Babpravi Portugal will win
"@YannickBZHCOL @wiwibloggs @destinymusicmt @thisismaneskin @Babpravi And i don't know why but i feel a big flop for Italy and finished 5th or 6th...For me France, Ukraine, Switzerland and Maybe Malta if she's good in the Jury and Public"
@YannickBZHCOL @wiwibloggs @destinymusicmt @thisismaneskin @Babpravi For Ukraine i don't know maybe the third place or second. But the problem of Ukraine and Italy it's the Jury don't vote more for us and it's the similar problem with France with the public... But i don't know the odds are very too positive with Italy in this moment...

Let's see if it's the same tonight !"
