"@tomwewin @dadimakesmusic It’s not you, it’s probably the small venue :p Who would’ve guessed trying to buy a ticket the day after Eurovision finals would’ve been too late?! 😭 Have fun!!! Hopefully they’ll upgrade venues for that show or the one in SF! (Hint hint)"
@ruthiehl @dadimakesmusic Oh no!! They are??? Yeah thats where I bought it. Sorry T___T
@abiclarkecomedy @dadimakesmusic @julia_hills @paul_clarkson1 @abiclarkecomedy i just came to your page because I was listening to the think about things song right now.. you honestly killed it🤭👌🏿👌🏿
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Please please please consider trying again at some point! You so deserve to perform live, and the world needs to see more of you and Gagnamagnid!!!!  (I'll definitely be keeping an eye on whatever you do next though, I'm hooked!)"
"So, it’s all over for another year. 😢  But what a Contest!  - Deserved win for @thisismaneskin  - 4/Top 5 not in English: 🇮🇹 🇫🇷🇨🇭🇺🇦  - Great for Francophones: 🇫🇷 &amp;🇨🇭  - Two of Big Five in 🥇and🥈places - FAB 4th for @dadimakesmusic  - 🇵🇹 makes left side of board🙀 - so does 🇲🇩😬"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision It's like being an Olympian...seriously impressed.
@tomwewin @dadimakesmusic Did you buy it through AXS? Looks like they’re sold out already 😭
"The Curator: Eurovision special featuring @dadimakesmusic, @destinymusicmt, @dunclaurence, @SietseBakker and ‘The Roop’ https://t.co/MojuHZMpN0"
@lindseyss @dadimakesmusic I haven’t found it either! Any chance you have??
@dadimakesmusic @danaalich he is us
@dadimakesmusic KING 👑
@Winterbay_ @dadimakesmusic They just keep getting better :)
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola What a happy marriage you showed Europe 👏
@dadimakesmusic AND it's on my birthday! 😞😥😢💔
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You were fab! 💞
Now on to my two faves: I am a huge fan of @dadimakesmusic and for a ton of reasons I did want them to win for his incredibly sweet and funky tribute to his wife.  But I have to admit that I preferred last year's song more. https://t.co/A3O52B3Rhz
"@dadimakesmusic oh! No! Your Chicago show is sold out?! Wonderful for you, not so much for us 😢💔"
"@scottdagostino @dadimakesmusic I liked last year's better, but their song this year was sweet"
"@dadimakesmusic just booked tickets to see you next June in Bristol, UK! really excited, thank you for touring over here! 😁"
@DETben @dadimakesmusic Plleeeeeeasssseeee?
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You were oustanding! 👏 Glad You finished in the top 4. I voted for You
@EleonoraAnne1 @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola They were some bucks tho😂
@CarolineDiamo14 @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Same. It's an unpredictable contest and I can't say that the Italian entry did it for me though I never want my mother's nation to lose.
@scottdagostino @dadimakesmusic Another cool thing about dadi and his videos is it all seems to be a family affair.
@OfficialWilllF More @dadimakesmusic if we are lucky
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola I absolutely loved every second of your performance!! You got yourself a fan &lt;333
@dadimakesmusic Thank you for being fantastic!
"@dcullenmusic @dadimakesmusic Yeah, if you watch the documentary they had for their new song as well it just shows the amount of work they are putting in as well. They had a computer game made this time round hehe"
@kickthepj @dadimakesmusic And we don't talk about my country's performance.
"@kickthepj @dadimakesmusic Lithuania was my favourite, i dig the icelandic costumes but not so much the music"
@EleonoraAnne1 @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Not one bit surprised to be honest. I really liked Germany's entry too. Can't believe it did so badly.
@dadimakesmusic @grumpy_copilot @Eurovision @arnyfjola dis jay?
@scottdagostino @dadimakesmusic That is a GREAT SONG.
@CarolineDiamo14 @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Think About Things also brilliant track. 28m views and counting..
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Please come back. We love you!

@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola I loved your song!! I was screaming at the TV every time you got points!! Well done!!
Shit should i go see the funky iceland boys @dadimakesmusic in brighton or london
@dadimakesmusic What is the flag in the left from? :)
@gingertotty @dadimakesmusic Brilliant.... loving these illustrations 😁🧡😁
@dadimakesmusic You' re the only one IN HISTORY taking part into ESC without taking part in ESC. Still in top 5! I LIKE 👍
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Congratulations on the future band member
"@dadimakesmusic In the U.K. that means there are 10 POINT 089 people. Separating number groups with a full stop has never made any sense to me, that’s a decimal point. Commas make far more sense."
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola My favorite ❤️ love from #Italy
@dominicsjr @dadimakesmusic I've been obsessed with this song for the past month and I'm stowing it away as something to send to my husband on our 10th anniversary in 2025
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Well, I already adopted Iceland men in footie (so much fun there during  Euro 16) so I may as well have you guys as my new favourite band. You make me grin like a mad thing."
@dadimakesmusic Should have been first place.
@woodenbin @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision it's in the same level as Silvia Nott
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Great stuff. Good luck.
I'm catching up with #Eurovision2021 and I'm so happy to see @dadimakesmusic . 10 years is amazing!
"@dadimakesmusic The only one I was still humming the next day,  so obviously it should have been the winner"
@dadimakesmusic Your dad is a freaking legend! 😆
@dadimakesmusic Could never be @Arsenal #afc 😉
@dadimakesmusic Amazing job!!
All the #Eurovision2021 chatter reminds me that this song from @dadimakesmusic is still my favourite thing ever: https://t.co/BshQG2eJZ7
@GilfoyleLuke @dadimakesmusic honestly though 👀👀
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Great show! Living your sounds 💙
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You were robbed!! 👍🏻
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola My favourite song! 💃🏼👏🏻👏🏻
@dadimakesmusic You would of won by a landslide if 2020 went ahead. Enter again next year and perform your original song “Think about things” 👌🏼👌🏼
"@joemasontv @dadimakesmusic Amanda, you look great x"

Wait a minute.  @dadimakesmusic looks like the actor Jason Mewes especially when he potraits Jay in Jay and Silent Bob movies and Dogma.  ❤️😂 Sorry Dadi hugs from Germany. https://t.co/gzkTwluus7
"WAIT, HOW DID I MISS THIS?! Thank you Seán for the wishes towards Iceland 🥰🇮🇸 Daði &amp; Co. did well despite the end result 😍 @dadimakesmusic https://t.co/aAM375kX5C"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You were my winners 🙌🏻😃💚
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Heard you for the first time on euro vision. Instant love. Tickets purchased for Glasgow. 😍
"@Footymufc1 @dadimakesmusic Mmm - subjective :-) I just thought it didn't go anywhere; bass line constantly followed the guitar so was dull (I play bass), and the 'bass solo' was poor. Musically, nothing interesting. No idea about the lyrics, and performance was a pretence of being a famous rock band."
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola I'm glad people and jury appreciated your performance
@DaraVelour @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision I can't find the second one https://t.co/MnVHRfUQwq
@DaraVelour @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Where is the second one? I've been trying to find it for a while but I just can't

"@AlanRanker @dadimakesmusic It was easily the most passionate and best performance. The song was better than most, and not a boring ballad. Clear winner."
@dadimakesmusic A great result. Australia🇦🇺 loves you!!!
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Love you guys 💗💗💗
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Thank you from Australia 🇦🇺. My wife and I love both of your Eurovision songs. Thank you for bringing your style of groove to music and tiktok inspiring dances moves. Hopefully your future continues Gagnamagnið's protection and bringing of good vibes to the world. 💗
"@ice_crystal @CherryRad @dadimakesmusic Ok, just my assumption Crystal"
"@F1shyBob @CherryRad @dadimakesmusic Well I do, occasionally, but I also shop at Home Bargains sometimes, so I'm not sure that theory stands up well."
@ice_crystal @CherryRad @dadimakesmusic I always assumed your name was Crystal and you shopped at Iceland 🤷‍♂️
"@F1shyBob @CherryRad @dadimakesmusic Har, I hadn't realised! ☺️"
@ice_crystal @CherryRad @dadimakesmusic Ok Iceland Crystal
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Because it keeps getting better :)
@CherryRad @dadimakesmusic Oh thank you! I'll have a watch of this!
Just heard @dadimakesmusic blasting out from someone's headphones on the tube... It made me feel happy! #ISL #Eurovision2021

@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You should have won!
@dadimakesmusic 4th place is good although you deserved 1st place
"@matthew__ashton @BricktalkTV @dadimakesmusic @bbceurovision @Eurovision The one from @BricktalkTV, crazy indeed! 😱"
@marcotenhoff @BricktalkTV @dadimakesmusic @bbceurovision @Eurovision Which tweet? That’s crazy!
@BricktalkTV @matthew__ashton @dadimakesmusic @bbceurovision @Eurovision Twitter is tagging your tweet as offensive content... 😔  We have a long way to go I guess. Really love these guys!
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You are our winners forever.
"A day later, Iceland's entry is still one of my favorite entries in #Eurovision! Behold the power of the fusion keytar circle and what it took to make that happen! Nice work, @dadimakesmusic!  https://t.co/4UdrgctNed"
"@dadimakesmusic from Spain, my girlfriend (@Balsi14 ) without rhythm, is trying to do the dance while she brushes her teeth, this is fantastic !!! Thanksssss!!!!"
@dadimakesmusic It was ja ja ding wrong that you didn't win 😔
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Thank you for your amazing song! We were rooting for Iceland all evening 😍😍❤️
"@Footymufc1 @dadimakesmusic When? I've just re-listened to Italy, and it's really not very good! Have you heard Gun? Saliva? Rage Against The Machine? Lordi? The Italy entry was unusual for Eurovision, but wasn't a patch on any of the above. And they put little effort into the performance!"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Great act thanx😀
"@IngaLalu @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Can't believe you've spotted me! So so proud to be in a very small part of Dadi's stellar journey. Say hi from me when he's back home! (You Iceland Creatives all know each other, right?)"
Icelandic musician Dadi Freyer who represented Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest has announced new dates &amp; venue upgrade with extra tickets now available. New dates take place in June 2022. See him in #Glasgow #Leeds &amp; more @dadimakesmusic   https://t.co/JqcOXDhRGm
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Thank you for everything! Especially thanks for letting me (and the rest of the choir) be part of a Eurovision song!
@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola Absolutely loved the song and performance. Love to you all from the UK and hope you are all feeling ok. Would love a follow please? I see Kim Wilde is following you - she is as I am sure you know a wonderful singer/writer/performer. She follows me on here.
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola my friends think we're related.  Do you wanna be my sibling? &lt;3
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Straight into the playlist. An amazing song and so incredibly hard to get out of your head! Next year is the year lads! 😁🤘

@dadimakesmusic How do you get 0.089 of a person? Is it like just one ear and the rest of the body is listening to something else?  Or is one person 1.089 of a person?  like in the early stages of pregnancy.
@dadimakesmusic Should have been first
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Should have done Ja Ja Ding Dong. 😐
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Loved your song
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Loved your song, last night and the previous time too - thank you for such great performances!"
@dadimakesmusic Should have been 1st 🥇
I can say with the most sincere honesty that yesterday's #EUROVISION Song Contest was the most entertaining piece of art I have seen this year.   Can't wait to see @dadimakesmusic &amp; @thisismaneskin live.
"@dadimakesmusic thanks for the great songs for Eurovision and looking forward to hearing many of your other work and future tracks too. Great Eurovision sense of perspective and humour too. Love the decision not to perform live , if not all together. Stay safe."
@dadimakesmusic Well deserved. You were my number one favourite to win!
@dadimakesmusic You’re 2020 absolute winners to me. And I was rooting for you and Måneskin this year. I would have been happy in the same if you folks won. VIVA DADI VIVA GAGNAMAGNID &lt;3 #Eurovision2021 #eurovision
@trumerz @dadimakesmusic @bbceurovision @grahnort I think you can buy them. I hope so. Something wrong with the world if you can't get them

@dadimakesmusic Your new album has been the soundtrack of my house (and tomorrow the soundtrack of my office) since it dropped. Playing on loop.
Just wondering if there's any possibility that learning the dance moves to @dadimakesmusic - 10 Years (#Iceland #Eurovision2021 song) would make me eligible for Icelandic citizenship?  Such an uplifting &amp; heartwarming track... Makes me want to be Icelandic!
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola I love your band! you are so... fascinating!

@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Thank you for a purely political result. We expected nothing less.
I think the BEST part of #Eurovision is all the amazing artists I never would have found otherwise.  Like @thisismaneskin @_Go_A_ #TheRoop @BlindChannelFIN @dadimakesmusic and so many others. I wish the absolute best futures to all who participated. 💜💜💜💜💜
@dizzy_pup @dadimakesmusic I wasn’t expecting the bridge to punch me directly in the heart. In a good way.
"@TraullGaming @dreykjalin @dadimakesmusic Honestly, I don't think they had any competition last year. But that is my personal taste. This year I think the quality overall was much better. Just screwed over by Covid-19 two years in a row, I guess"

@Atlantis1316 @leggerissimah @dadimakesmusic @thisismaneskin I thought the jury was quite fair this year tbh. I expected more for Lithuania and Ukraine but I can understand why france and switzerland got the points they got.
"@vicstarz79 @dadimakesmusic Loved the staging of the French one with the shaky camera close ups...poor UK aside, it is exciting how they do the scoring now"
"@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola @Eurovision You were FANTASTIC! Love, love, love your music."
One thing we need to take from this year's Eurovision is we categorically can never ever let @dadimakesmusic fade into obscurity. We need this forever.
@Unnursvana @leggerissimah @dadimakesmusic @thisismaneskin Jury in general . It is just a political game.
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You were the best.  Just downloaded your EP.  😊
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Can’t wait to see what your next project will be! 🤩
It’s official. @dadimakesmusic &amp; I made a collab of dreams https://t.co/4mEEQENIDj

@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Thank you for the music that you have given us! I'll wish you success in everything you do!
"@jordysniper @dadimakesmusic So excited hahaha, is it 2022 yet 😂"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Best wishes in your next endeavours. Remember in two years you have already conquered Europe. Next the World! #dadifreyr #Eurovision

@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola The best!!!!!
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola @dadimakesmusic Loved you on #Eurovision2021 last night. Definitely think you should market these fab jumpers and bring out a retro video game. Following to see what inspired craziness you bring out next.
@8bitnortherner @dadimakesmusic  Another fabulous design! 💕 Iceland... My winner!! 🏆
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You’re awesome. Cannot wait for what’s next 👏🏻
"Post #Eurovision euphoria, I have booked tickets for @dadimakesmusic in June 2022 at the Round House. It gives me a year to practise all the dance moves 😀"
"@dadimakesmusic This will go on a jumper, too! https://t.co/ean3LNTrao"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola *Clear my head. Your voice is simply amazing
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Robbed. Twice.
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola See you in april! ❤️
"Really looking forward to seeing @dadimakesmusic on tour next year. The level of creativity they brought to #Eurovision was awesome. Song, staging, choreography, music video, video game…  incredible! ❤️ https://t.co/sokKqTusvq"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Welcome is a triumph mate. Never usually watch Eurovision but glad I did. Clear my mind is my favourite on the EP.   A new fan x
"@dadimakesmusic amazing song, excellent drop and that last chorus!!! https://t.co/UUl83y78QU"
@JessBonsell @dadimakesmusic @SBSEurovision Thank you
@DemoiselleAsh @dadimakesmusic @SBSEurovision Haha omg this is amazing! 😍
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Your music was great 👍
"We need @tommcrae for UK's #Eurovision2022 entry. Already has a following in Europe (+cousins in Australia for votes), music style not unlike France's @Babpravi, and the vocal range of Switzerland's @gjonstearsoff. Dad dance moves and onesie merch like @dadimakesmusic optional."
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You guys are amazing!  Your music is so refreshing and inspires happiness and positivity.  I hope you will come back to Eurovision next year.  Third time lucky.  Wishing you all the very best of luck for the future and looking forward to hearing more music from you xxx
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Been listening to you all morning and have even done your 10 years dance tutorial with my daughter! ☺️
I know it’s daft but I have to say Eurovision &amp; booking tickets to see @dadimakesmusic have cheered me right up after a really rough few weeks. I feel so much better!
@dadimakesmusic you guys did so well :)
"@AlexPresents @dadimakesmusic Ha, cheers mate!"
@AJSchonfield @dadimakesmusic thank you mate!🧡 #dta
@dadimakesmusic My first Eurovision vote 🥺❤️ love you guys
@dadimakesmusic Well deserved! Though I hoped for you to win but happy Italy won too! 🌱✨🥰
@jhansonradio @dadimakesmusic loved every single second (not sure if you can tell)
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Gutted you guys didn’t win
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You are all amazing! Thanks so much for making us smile and for the wonderful last two years you have bought us with your Eurovision entries. Look forward to your next adventure wherever this takes you 🥰
"Nice to see @SBSEurovision put the translation on all non-English songs from the performance earlier this morning. Now I can understand what they're singing. Still, my 12 pts go to Iceland @dadimakesmusic Next faves: Ukraine , Lithuania, France, Switzerland  #Eurovision"
@RosieEggleston @dadimakesmusic Aw thanks Rosie☺️☺️
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Brilliant last night.  You were my favourite

"@happythirsty @dadimakesmusic Oh I've never heard of it, thank you!!"
@dadimakesmusic You guys deserved 1st place!!
@ESCShowcase @ForestFM @CiaranUT @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic @gjonstearsoff Will definitely be tuning in. The UK needs to rethink it's strategy.  This year we had lazy staging (what worked for Michael Ball in 1992 won't work 30 years later) and we are relying on the glory days of the late 1970s. James did the best he could with a challenging situation.
This cover version by @dadimakesmusic has made my Sunday: https://t.co/BwAtCLQpfC https://t.co/9NgJnVkdv8

"@happythirsty @dadimakesmusic hey, on which app is that?😊"
Had a dream this night of @dadimakesmusic inviting a bunch of people to my flat in order to film a new music video. I was so overwhelmed by everything that I could hardly speak but the whole experience was so much fun.   I guess Gagnamagnið hit me right in the kokoro.
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Thank you for being so cute the pair of you 🥰
@eddiesgl1 @dadimakesmusic I liked France Voilaaaaaa! Poor uk.. I thought was very catchy . Worth more than nil point
"@dadimakesmusic Congratulations! Great result, considering you couldn't even perform!  I hope they will invite you next year here in Italy as a honor guest to perform (and that you accept!)"
I missed this gem of a music video from @dadimakesmusic  https://t.co/OJqlukBzbK
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You did amazing!! Very deserved 4th place, congratulations"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You were fantastic and should have won! Hope to see you on tour next year!

@YesTom @dadimakesmusic So unlucky were robbed by COVID in 2020. Unfortunately although still excellent this years entry despite remaining delightfully quirky and so Eurovision the  novelty had gone.
"@dramabeatzz @dadimakesmusic Oh right same guys.  Yeah, gonna be a little hard to look up that act on Spotify..."
@dadimakesmusic You were great 👍
My new love is @dadimakesmusic The music just makes me happy. I can’t explain it 😂

"@TheMahonster @dadimakesmusic Think About Things.. they'd have 100% won. But even though it was cancelled, you can't re-enter the same song :(  https://t.co/D0JyZTPu8V"
@joemasontv @dadimakesmusic Born to do it
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola Thank you.
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You were robbed, both last year and this. But, I'm so glad to Eurovision for bringing you out into the limelight. What a fantastic, talented group you are.  Legends! ❤️"

Why in god's name did #Falco never do an entry for Eurovision? Answer - Because he didn't need to. Falco never won #Eurovision and #DadiFreyr doesn't need to win Eurovision to become an international sensation. Just sayin.' https://t.co/OZOfxwI1Tr via @YouTube
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision @arnyfjola You guys are amazing!✨🇮🇸🇮🇸

@dadimakesmusic Plus of course International fame and adoration! 😁
@AmandaDS @dadimakesmusic Tbf their song for last year was better and it’s a shame because they might have won it with that one. Maybe they’ll come back next year even better.🇮🇸
"@dadimakesmusic I'm not shocked, the track slaps~"
@Atlantis1316 @leggerissimah @dadimakesmusic @thisismaneskin The jury gave Iceland more points than the public did. What are you on about.
@dadimakesmusic You will still always be the 2020 winner
@Fengshen_Yanyi @dadimakesmusic Same i never wanna give them money for voting but this time I voted twice :D
See you at @Leadmill next year @dadimakesmusic 🇮🇸 https://t.co/HSEBk54k6V
@dadimakesmusic Cool! I was hoping for 1st place though. It was easily the best song of the evening.

This landed in my inbox and I nearly missed it. So glad I didn't. Tomboy by @banduninvited is a total BOP!  Talking of bops - @yearsandyears &amp; @kylieminogue is followed by the @Chromeo remix of @dadimakesmusic next! ♥️🕺💃🕺💃🕺♥️
@dadimakesmusic The icelandic moderator was also a fucking legend.
"@dadimakesmusic Gutted you guys had to watch from the hotel. Great song, great sound, great look. 12 points from Scotland"
"And if you’ve missed my Eurovision coverage, on The Curator we have a selection of interviews I did w/ The Roop, @dadimakesmusic from Iceland, @destinymusicmt from Malta + the show’s executive producer @SietseBakker and more ✨🏆✨   @monocle24 https://t.co/UQxIXE3VBN"

"@dadimakesmusic 1st place in my eyes. Best keyboards, best jumpers, best moves. I Like."
I fulfilled a life dream by standing in to announce the UK’s (fake) 12 points in Friday Night’s #Eurovision jury final. Still cannot believe the REAL @dadimakesmusic was there to receive them!🤩  My life has well and truly peaked https://t.co/kOmRUXBdKA
I think we can all agree last night was Iceland’s night even if they didn’t win. From @dadimakesmusic to Ja Ja Ding Dong. They would’ve put on an amazing show next year too I’m sure... #Eurovision
"New albums out this week from BSÍ, @Olivia_Rodrigo, @outsidechild13, @LordHuron, @SineadHarnett &amp; @twentyonepilots. Find out soon which is our #AlbumoftheWeek...   #NowPlaying: @subradioband - King of my Heart   Soon: @dadimakesmusic, @theacesofficial &amp; @_DennisArana"

@shadylady222 @dadimakesmusic Well I came close .. 🤣🤣  #eurobanter
@dadimakesmusic 🇮🇸Love from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Also am I a crazy person who painted my own @dadimakesmusic sweater today after the 5 am live show this morning because I thought Iceland needed more representation at my @SBSEurovision party? Apparently so. #SBSEurovision #Eurovision #ISL https://t.co/WEKr86v5vz
@dadimakesmusic The pixel art on the sweaters reminds me of the game Maniac Mansion.
@dadimakesmusic I like! As well!
"We made these @dadimakesmusic costumes at 5am this morning while watching #SBSEurovision live, ready for our watch party tonight! @ShanleyPrice #Eurovision https://t.co/nNZWBvW03Q"
@dadimakesmusic You're a king
I’ve slept on it and Iceland were still robbed I hope they release another album #Eurovision @dadimakesmusic
"There are only two types of people in the world: those who like Iceland’s @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision entry, and those who are wrong. That is all. #Eurovision"
@nikitareds @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision I will take the whole week off next year. It's exhausting
Just woke up and went to buy tickets for @dadimakesmusic in Glasgow and I think they're already sold out. Gutted. I'm away back to sleep!
i'm glad that everyone has discovered @dadimakesmusic now
Can I love you more Iceland? #iceland #hatari #dadifreyr #Eurovision https://t.co/aeYUkWSgLq
@Moira_FOK @dadimakesmusic I'm sorry but Amsterdam was sold out 2 days ago.
@dadimakesmusic The beat song by far - absolutely loved it ❤️
@dadimakesmusic @skarttel you guys were AMAZING 🙌🙌 congrats on 4th place and winning over all our hearts!
@dadimakesmusic you were robbed!
Forget the UK’s nul points. The real injustice was that Iceland’s @dadimakesmusic didn’t win. My wife’s taken our fandom to the next level #Eurovision https://t.co/095nULsiRM
"@dadimakesmusic You won 2020 without performing on a Eurovision stage and placed 4th in 2021 without performing in front of the audience. I’m gonna buy a ticket for your Amsterdam show next year real quick. 2 times I missed out on seeing this tall god live, 2022 has to give it to me! 😂❤️🇮🇸"
@dadimakesmusic You guys were amazing! Loved the performance!

Thank you #Eurovision for introducing me to @dadimakesmusic
"@dadimakesmusic Comfortably the best song, and if you’d been able to perform live I truly doubt you’d have come anywhere but first.   That said, coming 4th whilst literally sitting on a sofa is a measure of your titanic status.  Truly the winner we were not worthy of."
@dadimakesmusic we vibes with you yesterday! Absolutely loved it! And 4th place is amazing🥰 https://t.co/REZFVEy0uf
@SciWriBy @dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola My faith in humanity is at an all-time low.

"@dadimakesmusic @sigrunnbirnaa @StefanHannesson Yet another fantastic and joyous song, just what we need. Can’t wait to see you perform in London!"
@EmmaMusgrave @dadimakesmusic Or frozen supermarket chains
@totitolvukall @dadimakesmusic 1000 billion zillion points. And minus infinity points for all others combined. The only true and fair outcome!
"@dadimakesmusic Well, to be fair, You were 1st place for a minute or two, after Televoting 🥰"
@dadimakesmusic You are the real winners. Including this amazing jury guy.
time to listen to @dadimakesmusic until my brain melts

"@dadimakesmusic Like, maybe I can move to Berlin and maybe you can be my new boyfriend"
@dadimakesmusic Totally not your fault but if ye were there live I’d say first place 🥇❤️
"❤️ @dadimakesmusic  Also well played to Ukraine, Russia and Finland. All very strong entries. Also @jamesnewman you did deserve more points. Strongest UK entry in years! #eurovision https://t.co/Dul7JJBjN3"

@Leicstar @dadimakesmusic that’s fun 🤩
@amzina @dadimakesmusic Omg! Well I know what I’m asking for for my birthday now! ❤️❤️❤️
@mikeBithell @dadimakesmusic this would be an awesome collaboration!
@dadimakesmusic You are the winner by heart!
@dadimakesmusic Congrats!! 🌼🥺
@adamwilbourn @dadimakesmusic It was definitely the best one!🙌😊
"I have an app that records me sleep talking (I do it literally every night) and last nights was ‘big love for Iceland, big love’ can you tell I was invested in Eurovision 😂🤦🏻‍♀️ @dadimakesmusic"
"@Fionasstalker @scottygb @BBCRadioScot Didn’t deserve 0 points - it wasn’t an awful song, just a bit bland for Eurovision. I loved the madness of Ukraine &amp; Iceland are just adorable, I’ve already booked my ticket for @dadimakesmusic in Glasgow next year 💃"
@DaniedmundsDani It’s easier than you think! https://t.co/kXyzRw9IWy on @dadimakesmusic’s website.
@HannahMGeorge @dadimakesmusic How did I just use the exact same gif as you 🤦🏾‍♀️
"@dadimakesmusic Should have won last year, should have won this year. But congratulations on 4th place.  All the family loved it, my kids have insisted on putting you on this morning."
@Alexrjpaterson What do you think @dadimakesmusic ?

@dadimakesmusic You're the greatest!
@LesleyRiddoch @andrewlearmonth @dadimakesmusic June 8th at SWG3 also sold out.
"@dadimakesmusic I am so, so proud of you ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
@HannahMGeorge @dadimakesmusic Hahaha I think this is a postponed date so it is certainly possible. Gutted for them but I’m reassuring myself that (1) it would be bittersweet to have won in absentia and (2) Italy for Eurovision is a DOABLE TRIP 🤩🥳 https://t.co/27Fc0aLXF9
@TimboTalks @andrewlearmonth @dadimakesmusic Blast. Second gig maybe @dadimakesmusic?
@dadimakesmusic Well done. Great song. Love your music. 😊🎶
@PresidentISL @dadimakesmusic Please ah would like 2 further in Iceland

@TLATWuk @dadimakesmusic Different one! Very good.
@reelbigdawson @Tregolwyn @jmwroe Dinner in the pub + 3 week old baby life meant I was asleep by the time you asked Jason!  Cyprus was my favourite although I think for the second year @dadimakesmusic was robbed by Covid-19
@dadimakesmusic Congratulation! Iceland is amazing! 😍😍😍😍
@dadimakesmusic Was rooting for the win! But well deserved high placement either way!
"@dadimakesmusic Awesome song, you should have one, love the videos on YouTube 👍👍❤️ Keep it up 👍 more please, you need an album 💿 🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸"
@adamwilbourn @dadimakesmusic The moment they combined the keyboards in a circle was genius. Best Eurovision for ages a lot less attempts at making generic pop and lots of full on “insanity” “novelty “ pure Eurovision!
"@dadimakesmusic Congrats, you were amazing even without the live audience's vibe! We'll be following your career with great interest! :)"
@dadimakesmusic Congratz from Sweden! Grattis! 🇮🇸 🇸🇪
@dadimakesmusic Congratulations to you all! Very well deserved 👏🏻❤️

@xemmasulway @dadimakesmusic I also love that Iceland got “the Ja Ja Ding Dong guy” to announce the jury points.
@dadimakesmusic @kobalt Sorry but absolutely terrible ......
@dadimakesmusic You should have won! Amazing!
"@dadimakesmusic I just love that when you were first place, you celebrated by balancing your mug on your head 😂 You guys are fab!"
"Well, something we have to seriously consider, although the possibility to offer @dadimakesmusic British citizenship would be my preference.. Absolutely love those guys from #Iceland would have won in 2020 &amp; won our hearts in 2021 ❤️❤️🇦🇽🇬🇧 #Eurovision2021 #Eurovision https://t.co/QRblATOmNF"

pls can you collab @dadimakesmusic @parcelsmusic
@ztevil @kickthepj @dadimakesmusic so glad they brought him into it. The one thing esc was really missing is american celebrities as candidates /j
"@dadimakesmusic We love you guys and are so proud. Always winners no matter what, because of you being your authentic selves. Nothing but good things ahead for you and Gagnamagnid. See you in Dublin 2022! #everythingaboutyouIlike"
"@dadimakesmusic @RuthFCarden OK, I watched ""10 years"" video this morning. It is good, and a good song but it's still not as good as ""Think about things"". Although I do like the nod to the Beastie Boys Intergalactic."
hi king! my mom is obsessed and said that she wants you to sell sweatshirt and t-shirts with custom pixelated faces @dadimakesmusic
Well I adored Italy and their sexy vibes but Iceland @dadimakesmusic and Gagnamagnið will always be the winners in my heart 💚 and I can’t wait to see them in Brighton next year! https://t.co/K54dhjMdoi

@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola @Eurovision You made us so happy. Thank you.

"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision I got my name changed in late 2020. Seeing my new name on this, on top of the entire experience, and the fact that a friend who lives hours away also was in here with me, has made me so happy.  There aren't enough ways to say thank you"

@dadimakesmusic You'll always be 1st in my eyes #realwinner
"@dadimakesmusic That's a great idea.  I think the song Husavik would win.  It's really what the moviegoers are looking for.  It's the only song that could improve upon the songs previously played, Think About Things and Ten Years."
@dadimakesmusic Well done you! https://t.co/4koFZalPg1
@dadimakesmusic You would have won in 2020! Come back again!
@dadimakesmusic That is an amazing place! You guys rock!

"I personally don't keep up with #Eurovision as much as most Europeans, as I generally find most of the performances a tad tacky. I will say though, I'm pleasantly intrigued by the lineup this year.   @dadimakesmusic's stage is an immediate winner for me: https://t.co/Y66jiVFWVS"

@RazorLou @dadimakesmusic Big goddamn Daði fan. I love that the lyrics to gangamagnið in english are like ‘we’re in a club and I’m horny’ but in icelandic they’re like ‘we’re literally aliens and you humans are destroying yourselves and the only way to prevent it is learning this dance.’
Changed my profile pic in honor of @dadimakesmusic whose music career I'm most excited to follow out of all the Eurovision 2021 artists. Too bad the Philippines is too far away from Iceland. Can't wait to see what you come up with next!

"@dadimakesmusic Wowowowowowowow, absolutely loved the vibe you all brought to Eurovision over the last two years (not to mention those special voting videos). Good luck for the future, Daði &amp; co (&amp; new baby)."
@dadimakesmusic you should definitely come to brazil one day!
So @dadimakesmusic couldn’t enter think about thinks this year because they entered it last year?! Does that mean they can enter it next year as they didn’t enter it this year? #Eurovision #ITALY2022 #husavik2023
@dadimakesmusic You were robbed!! Kept redialling! Said to son you remind me of Hot Chip- then found the remix of yours on Spotify- by Hot Chip. Kudos to  mother!! 👏😆 https://t.co/PYXxIhF0zU
"@dadimakesmusic @sigrunnbirnaa @StefanHannesson I saw you and voted for you, totally gutted you didn’t win :-( you should have 😘 with love from nil point uk 😘🇬🇧"

@Kraslie @dadimakesmusic Ticketmaster was being weird. Seems they have some tickets left for dates I might be able to travel across the Irish Sea for actually. 😁
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision so happy I got to be part of this choir!
@dadimakesmusic I am with @SimonJCLeBON - you guys are amazing and I’m so sorry you didn’t win 💜💜💜

@ACchlothes @dadimakesmusic The fact I don’t own a giant Icelandic flag has me questioning my life decisions
@dadimakesmusic placing 4th from their hotel room is ICONIC #Eurovision

"@dadimakesmusic @Gaohmee You would be very welcome in Cambridge, UK. Come when you can!"
"I mean, I was already plotting a trip to Iceland, because @Icelandair kinda kicks ass, and what else am I gonna do for turning 50? But seeing @dadimakesmusic livwe would be a bonus."
"@dadimakesmusic You definitely deserved to win, but no matter, you already made it to our playlists! Keep up the good work! 👏"
@dadimakesmusic should get to represent Iceland next year. And every year after that !
"@dadimakesmusic @IgnerG @arnyfjola @Eurovision Well done, very nice song, great act!"
Well @dadimakesmusic #ISL was pure fuckin robbed and I’m gutted... but hey @MackieRach - road trip to Italia next year 😁🇮🇹 #EUROVISION

"@dadimakesmusic I need you and Gagnamagnið to know that you did so great and 4th place even with all these circumstances, is something to be SO PROUD of. The song is amazing, you are amazing, would've loved to see you on tour but Amsterdam was sold out (!) already😔"
"@TheStupendium @dadimakesmusic We've had SUCH a strong finale this year. I'm quite pleased with Iceland being on #4, they are of course the #1 in my heart! &lt;3"

"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Thank you for letting us be a part of this. And, of course, congratulations - 4th place in this tremendous final is marvellous!"
@Dai_Lynch @dadimakesmusic Me too. Husavik forever.

Also fuck Ticketmaster for defaulting to two tickets. So... if I know you irl and you’d like to come with me (and friends) to the roundhouse for @dadimakesmusic then I have a ticket for you
@abarnesbrown I was hoping Iceland and @dadimakesmusic would take the win. #Eurovision

"@trad_dad @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision My 2 teens were shocked Iceland didn’t win, we all love last years and this years song! I didn’t hear Italy until they won - I was shocked - hated it 😳 We all did 😳"
@AoSCoach @dadimakesmusic Yeah absolutely! I liked the Italian song too!
"@dadimakesmusic more dates for Scotland please!! Missed out, and my daughter and I would love to come and see you do your stuff!!"
"@dadimakesmusic Very good result, you are amazing. A big hug from Spain. I have danced with you and I am very very happy for you"
@dadimakesmusic You guys did AMAZING!
@dadimakesmusic You were robbed. You should have won it. Most talented artist in the competition. x
@GingerGourmand Pretty sure @dadimakesmusic would be stoked with that review. Funky funny unusual is their motto!
@PresidentISL @dadimakesmusic What about a #FreePalestine ? 🥰❤️❤️
@RustyMcGee @dadimakesmusic We even had the biscuits to prove it. https://t.co/5VeAZhMSOD
@dadimakesmusic we loved your performance and everything you bring. Keep making music. You are fantastic x
@dadimakesmusic was my winner! #Eurovision
@nikitareds @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Well I have hope . My kids watched 2 semi finals and the final today. None of us picked Italy. Looks like a good time was had. I got to take part in a small way thanks to @dadimakesmusic Looking forward to seeing @dadimakesmusic on tour in #Sheffield in 2022
@jamesmiller_ @dadimakesmusic Tickets for June 2022 still available

Absolutely gutted for @dadimakesmusic and gagnamagnid. Iceland deserved the win   #EUROVISION
@TomCampbell @dadimakesmusic deserved to win 🤷‍♂️ Ja Ja Ding Dong next year
"@titch3435 @TerryReintke 100% agree.  The song was trash. His singing was dreadful.  Iceland with @dadimakesmusic leading the way with Gagnamagnið we're by far the best. Best song tonight and in the Eurovision that never was (2020), they were the best as well. #Iceland #EUROVISION"
"@dadimakesmusic We’re sat here in Glasgow angry at the result. Italy just showed nipples, you showed love.   #ShowLove #Eurovision"
Downloaded #gjonstears and @dadimakesmusic. So happy/ugly crying @bbceurovision @Eurovision
"What. A. Night!!  So pleased to see @dadimakesmusic and @_Go_A_ in the #EUROVISION Top 5 tonight, especially such high public votes to Ukraine! Can't wait to see both acts live in the not too distant future!"

@PresidentISL @dadimakesmusic Iceland were robbed.
@dadimakesmusic Congrats on 4th Place! You made your country proud. I’m sorry you couldn’t perform in the final and we all know you would have won last year! I hope you can see we all support you and you won in our hearts &lt;3
@dadimakesmusic Genuine question - where/when/how can I buy all the jumpers?
@dadimakesmusic will forever be the one that got away #Eurovision
@scottygb @dadimakesmusic Loved Iceland ❤️ should’ve won..😭
the main thing that's come out of tonight is we are all @dadimakesmusic megafans now
Thought @dadimakesmusic’s ‘10 Year’ sounded like a long time and then I realised @gevauden and I have been together for 11. “We got a good thing going” #Eurovision
@afrew43 @dadimakesmusic It was such a shame they didn't get to perform live. Might have picked up a few more points! Overall such a fun show despite strange result.
@dadimakesmusic @sigrunnbirnaa @StefanHannesson I like your sweater. Can I have one?
Gonna tell my kids @dadimakesmusic won Eurovision 2020 https://t.co/ayNbDHh5uo
"Also, what a one of a kind performance by @dadimakesmusic and his wonderful bandmates. So weird and so unique! #Eurovision #ESC2021 I‘m pretty sure you guys would‘ve won in 2020!"
"Ok, #Iceland @trad_dad @dadimakesmusic were robbed in @Eurovision tonight, no wonder the next generation have no clue what Eurovision is 😳 we keep voting crap songs to win 🙈🙈😱 Iceland were the clear winners tonight!"
"@PresidentISL @dadimakesmusic Dont worry in 3 hours France Will be the champions 🇫🇷 Have à Nice ""coke"""
"@Pandrea100 @dadimakesmusic Totally agree, and to that end I have decided they are the winners. Some seriously fucked up voting across the whole thing. Still love the madness of it all. Felt a bit flatter this year but they did well."
"I know I keep going on about it, but @dadimakesmusic has bought me so much joy in a very, very horrible year. It sounds really stupid 😅"
"Congratulations Italy 🇮🇹, winners of #Eurovision. So proud of our  @dadimakesmusic and Gagnamagnið who did exceptionally well in challenging circumstances.  See you all in Húsavík 🇮🇸 #jajadingdong"
"@squashmoen @dadimakesmusic Top 5, we take those"
@Schubes17 @dadimakesmusic I’ll be there!
@dadimakesmusic itvwas amazing! Looking forward to seeing you in Leeds in November!
There are winners and there are winners. I think most of Europe knows that @dadimakesmusic are the moral victors of the last two years. Giving us all hope and joy. #Eurovision
@afrew43 @dadimakesmusic I still think they would have won last year but given eccentric voting results maybe it's better they have the notional victory.
@jocyhannah @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Hi neighbour!
@dadimakesmusic WAS THIS ENOUGH https://t.co/9kwtpXOOkg
I have booked tickets to see @dadimakesmusic at the O2 &amp; The Roundhouse and am very excited. Yay!

@SaraMcSorley @dadimakesmusic Awwww! I found your name!
Even though I hoped Iceland would come higher they did absolutely brilliantly and I was so proud to see the pansexual flag waving to the world @dadimakesmusic #Eurovision
@dadimakesmusic YOU WERE ROBBED

"@JnnWalrus @dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Hello, we're neighbours on the list 👋😁"

@dadimakesmusic I annoyed most of my friends in Europe to vote for you!!!!! I’m crying very happy tears that you guys made top 5. Absolutely deserved
@katrinvaht @dadimakesmusic @sigrunnbirnaa @StefanHannesson In that they had them for breakfast?
In my mind these are the final results of #Eurovision2021. Congrats to @dadimakesmusic on your amazing run. I hope the band feels better soon. See you in LA at the Roxy in March https://t.co/9HZ6RaGU7H

@adamwilbourn @dadimakesmusic You rioting yet?
@james_m_paints @dadimakesmusic They were great. Lots of strong options for winner . Sad some of their members tested positive
@dadimakesmusic @kobalt Well there’s no accounting for EuroVision accounting - not sure who voted but as entertaining as Italy’s entry was it was no winner.
"Hey @dadimakesmusic  you were robbed, twice #icelandwasrobbed https://t.co/8jQE62CNGL"
Well done Iceland!!!!! @dadimakesmusic #Eurovision
Now that Eurovision is over me and @AJTeevin can finally watch the videos for all our favourite acts (we don't listen to songs before the final) and the 10 years video just has me more convinced that my calling is to be a terrible @dadimakesmusic tribute act
@dadimakesmusic @kobalt Congratulations for your fourth place👏 i voted for you 🇮🇸👍
Well done to @dadimakesmusic for coming a very respectable 4th 👏👏🇮🇸 https://t.co/tOdAPGfNwU

@dadimakesmusic you’ll always be my number one . #Eurovision
"Started the night not knowing anyone on #Eurovision, ended it with two tix to see @dadimakesmusic in Glasgow, so I am the real Eurovision winner here."
"@dadimakesmusic Covid has caused a lot of bad in my life, but Daði og Gagnamagnið not getting to perform live is the last straw! I reckon you would've won if you were actually there 😂"
@beanowashisname @dadimakesmusic There’s a tutorial on YouTube.... 😉

Which @dadimakesmusic tune is your favourite? 🇮🇸 #Eurovision
@dadimakesmusic @sigrunnbirnaa @StefanHannesson You should have won 🥲🥲🥲
"@dadimakesmusic Maxed out my 20 votes for you and I'm so, so proud of how well you did ❤ 🇮🇸 Can't wait to see you in Dublin next year 🇮🇪 Truly hope you get the chance to perform live on the Eurovision stage one day 🙏🌟"
@nicky_doubleU @dadimakesmusic I think they have a sense of humour in their music that we get. They are brilliant.
"@dadimakesmusic top 5 is absolutely fantastic and regardless of result, you’ve found a long-time fan in me! Gutted you couldn’t be there, but I hope you’re all keeping safe and that everyone’s got access to the care and support they need 💜🇮🇸  #icelandwererobbed"
"Iceland were robbed!   In other news, I might be a bit in love with @dadimakesmusic"
Imo Iceland and @dadimakesmusic deserved the win- BUT I’m happy they got top 4!!! Good job I love y’all #Eurovision
That was thoroughly enjoyable. Worthy winners I think although disappointed for @dadimakesmusic nice watching a sport other than cycling 😜 not surprised with UK points. I would have given Germany 3 for fun and meme factor and UK zero.😂 didn’t hate it just not great #Eurovision
Well done @dadimakesmusic honestly you guys rock!!!
"Iceland, you can be incredibly proud with placing 4th! And that with a recorded act! Loved it to bits! #eurovision @dadimakesmusic"

Lots of good #Eurovision songs this year but @dadimakesmusic has my heart 🇮🇸 Request to @Eurovision for future: change rules so that acts must sing at least part of the song (verses?) in an official language of their country. Bitte. Danke 🙏🏼 #OpenUp https://t.co/QJAUooO81W
@trumerz @dadimakesmusic @bbceurovision @grahnort With Finland a close second and Russia third. But Iceland have something for everyone. I want a jumper.

"Also:  Apparently @dadimakesmusic and his wife @arnyfjola make all their instruments, including the circular fusion keyboard, so they should win for that reason alone.  https://t.co/5x36MwjyVF  #Eurovision #ISL https://t.co/Vl0DrZNiOe"

@ohIdoliketobe @dadimakesmusic I’m just letting mine stay up #BadMother
Iceland deserve to win just for this spectacular finish.  And also because their song is a banger and last year's song was a banger that would have won and @dadimakesmusic is amazing. #Eurovision https://t.co/ud4zzTFdPK
@AnneMarie YES THEYRE SO GOOD @dadimakesmusic !!!!
@ventevogel @instructables @dadimakesmusic @V_Saggiomo already found the video: https://t.co/d6S2nxuZck  I think we add interactivity to those and even a detector that would detect (and react) when connected to each other.

I support @dadimakesmusic and all his life choices that have made him make this kind of music

@WeRWorld @dadimakesmusic I just noticed it is in March so of course it is next year! My heart is broken for them that they cannot perform at the final. I shall be voting for them as I did last night in the semi final.

@dadimakesmusic @arnyfjola @Eurovision You should compete in the grand finals while simultaneously eating a delicious sandwich or other delicious meal.
@WeRWorld @dadimakesmusic Would this not have been cancelled due to 2 of the barn members testing positive for covid? I hope to travel to Iceland and see them one day.

My colleague just came to me and told me how much he loved @dadimakesmusic he did not even think about it is a rehearsal show! And a hint - that guy just watched the contest for a first time!
Booked to see @dadimakesmusic next June in Sheffield. It’s been years since I’ve been to The Leadmill... or even Sheffield properly. Will 100% make a little weekend out of it - and maybe even squeeze in a visit to my family!

"@dadimakesmusic hi Daði, I'm so sorry people have been so harsh to you, you don't deserve it 💔💔  (Anyway, can you say fantaeurovision in a story/live story? It's for an italian game, if you say it we could earn +50 points 🥺)"
@dadimakesmusic Good Luck for Saturday!!!❤️
@dadimakesmusic Personally I would have used this in my favour. I would have said my grandmother is ill in hospital and her dream was to see me on stage on Saturday. Then drop a tear or two. Pure X-Factor marketing. But then again you’re a decent guy.
@dadimakesmusic Fick the begruders
"@markpopham you're right, books and @dadimakesmusic tickets are absolutely necessary"
"As an American, I’ve been deprived of the magic that is Eurovision for my entire life... until yesterday.   Thank you @peacockTV for introducing me to my new favorite band of all time, @dadimakesmusic og Gagnamagnið"

@dadimakesmusic How excited are you to win then?!!!
@dadimakesmusic The question they should be asking about Eurovision feelings: How does it feel to have a wife and daughter who are so cool that they inspired two Eurovision songs?
I am very excited because this morning I just bought tickets for @dadimakesmusic tour next year in cologne. Hopefully @IsThisEvilyn and I will be there and see you live 💜 I am rooting for you tomorrow and I'm kinda sad that you can't perform live 🙃

"@dadimakesmusic I hope you're feeling amazing! You made it to the grand final! I'm so pumped for you!   You make kickass music, even though I can only hum along to the Icelandic songs :D"
@dadimakesmusic Can I ask you how chuffed you are about having a luxury Chromeo remix instead?
@EuroJook @dadimakesmusic They didnt even out it online. :/
@omnomchocolate @Eurovision @dadimakesmusic Here in the UK we specialiss in coming in last 5 with hardly any points. Our songs are never reflective of our real music... Just awful
"@dadimakesmusic That's heartless, I don't know what kind of answer they expect to hear."

@dadimakesmusic Kisses from Perú 🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪 i'm so happy you are on the final!!
@dadimakesmusic Ok but how good do you have to be to be the first ever group in Eurovision to get through to the final while not even being there?! That’s quite an achievement in my opinion 👏🏻
@dadimakesmusic How can you be sad with a banger song like yours?
@dadimakesmusic @Chromeo It is &lt;chef’s kiss&gt;
"@dadimakesmusic We are STOKED for you @dadimakesmusic ! An amazing Eurovision performance aired last night, a new EP dropped, and tour dates selling now. Everything's coming up DADI"

I found out @dadimakesmusic is the same height as me and it really provides some perspective I don't normally get
🇮🇸 I think it would be great to have some empty arena shots replaced with some live shots of the crowd singing along with @dadimakesmusic That would totally uplift the performance! https://t.co/MHWafk0S3Q

@dadimakesmusic I haven't asked if you're sad!

@susan_snowy @dadimakesmusic Back in touch with my emotions after a difficult year of lockdown ...
@elyob @dadimakesmusic What's that all about then?
@elyob @dadimakesmusic Oh I did that too! They would have definitely won if it had gone ahead. I'm not sure why they didn't just postpone it until this year so all the same songs were entered instead of all new songs 🤔
@susan_snowy @dadimakesmusic Then I realised what they're about ... changed my life ...
@susan_snowy @dadimakesmusic I put my first bet back in 2020 ...
"@elyob @dadimakesmusic I only got 10/1 on Ladbrokes. I put a bet on then realised I'd already put one on back in March, doh! So I really really hope they win 😁"
@dadimakesmusic Hello from California USA! We are cheering for you guys! (and we are learning the 10 Years Dance) 😁 https://t.co/ncwbjv6EgX

@dadimakesmusic Yes and  12 points from Spain goes to you ❤
I'm not too clued up on #Eurovision but I can say that Iceland have been fucked over 2 years running now and I for one will not stand for it! I'll be voting for @dadimakesmusic in the finals!!
@dadimakesmusic Sending you guys all the feels tonight. What a crazy ride this has been. You're all amazing and bring everyone joy.
@dadimakesmusic Love you guys and voting for you from 🇬🇧
@Wallid74 @dadimakesmusic You should be a host...
"@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision So sad that you won't get to perform live, but I wish you all good health and I am sure your recording will be almost as good as live. You have in my opinion the best song of the year, it just makes you happy. ☺️. 💙❤️"
"@JVision01 @wiwibloggs @victoriageorge_ @dadimakesmusic I'm afraid about the hosts. I mean they were next to Duncan during the first semi-final, giving the 1 billion stream listening disc, 2 days after this Duncan is tested positive 😕"
@dadimakesmusic second test?? Maybe it was a false positive? Or maybe an unscrupulous competitor faked it somehow? Couldn't take the heat? Maybe I've been watching too much British crime drama?🤣everything is crossed for tonight...but you won't need it.  You got this!  Stay safe!
@dadimakesmusic I'm so sorry. You are my favorite. Still voting for you guys. Get better! Good luck!

Who's qualifying from #Eurovision semi final 2 tonight? Our predictions https://t.co/WhxoOppDV2 #OpenUp  #DadiFreyr #Eurovision2021
"@floureite @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic wait, why are you photoshopping dog pictures? I need more information about this😂"
@floureite @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic The Eurovision account just tweeted it   https://t.co/B5B7dc2XXu
@dadimakesmusic Fingers crossed 🤞
"@emeraldsroses @Claudsonclouds @dadimakesmusic wait, huh, where though? i can't find it"
@SamperorT @dadimakesmusic Same with Australia on Tuesday.
@emeraldsroses @Claudsonclouds @dadimakesmusic Damn. That was obvious. Thanks. I'm photoshopping dog pictures so I'm not very active;
@dadimakesmusic @soundpeturuss OK but he does not look old enough to have a grandchild!
@dadimakesmusic Good luck! You guys got the loudest cheers on the jury show!
The last winner @dunclaurence will give the new winner the trophy. Cant imagine how they manage it when @dadimakesmusic will win (btw ❤️ 10 years!) This must be the most iconic moment in ESC history! I hope you are all fine and get healthy very soon!  @Eurovision #Eurovision
"I make my @eurovision debut tonight, as part of the choir for @dadimakesmusic entry for Iceland. This could be the start of a whole new life for me 😀 Seriously though, delighted to be (a really, really tiny) part of this and hoping Iceland make it to the final! How exciting!"
"@dadimakesmusic Even though you weren’t there, yesterday evening at the jury show everyone was vibing and enjoying your performance sooo much, I think you maybe got the loudest applause ❤️"
"@Claudsonclouds @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic Ooof yikes, where are you getting these updates?? 'm so out of the loop"
"@floureite @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic Yeah I'll be voting for them as well! Priority is to get them in for the final 🤟  The 2019 winner just tested positive though, so let's hope there's no outbreak 😂"
@victoriageorge_ @dadimakesmusic @dunclaurence Thank God you're fine🙏 I wouldn't be able to handle it 😿
"@Claudsonclouds @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic Meh, this is so sad though :( damn; anyway, voting tonight even though i can't watch. :) The only true winners of Eurovision anyway. :D"
"@dadimakesmusic Eventhough the circumstances. I am so happy you finally get to show off the beautiful essence of you and Gagnamagnid through 2nd rehearsals, during which you had the absolute most fun anyway, and shall still get a decent result.  Break a leg 💪"
"Sending all my love and support to @dadimakesmusic, Gagnamagnið and @dunclaurence 💙"
"@emeraldsroses @floureite @dadimakesmusic We'll see, Johann said he is feeling well and hoping for a miracle to perform on Saturday, so maybe if he (and everyone else) tests negative in the next couple of days they'll get to perform"
@dadimakesmusic You’ll be getting my votes from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
@dadimakesmusic Good luck ! You have a French vote for sure 😉
"@floureite @Claudsonclouds @dadimakesmusic The other positive was someone else from the delegation, then a couple of days later all tests were negative. That's what I understood."
"@Claudsonclouds @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic Thanks! That explains my confusion (and my ""serious question"") thanks so much! :)"

@dadimakesmusic Hi Daði - I work for BBC Breakfast Television in the UK. We were wondering if you'd be up for speaking to us about #Eurovision ? Please follow back so we can discuss in more detail via DM? Many Thanks.
I just got tickets for @dadimakesmusic Stockholm show in 2022 ❤️

"@dadimakesmusic Best of luck tonight, your 2nd rehearsal clip is as awesome as the live performance would be! Best regards to you and Gagnamagnið. ❤❤"
"@floureite @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic There's been two tests: First: Everyone in the band was negative, but another member of Iceland (could be a manager, sound, etc) tested negative. Second: Johann tested positive but everyone else tested negative. There will be more tests to see if anyone else testes positive."
@dadimakesmusic I'll be voting for you (and Finland) all the way tonight. Good luck! 😀👍🏽
@dadimakesmusic I think I know who infected them https://t.co/rVOQaIoAAk
@dadimakesmusic and you'll qualify!
@dadimakesmusic Is this the first time in Eurovision history that someone don't actually perform live and still is part of the day's competition? Or was it the same already with Australia on Tuesday? #historyinthemaking #Eurovision2021

"Worrying news from #Eurovision today. After @dadimakesmusic from Iceland withdraws from live performances due to a positive Covid test, now the 2019 Dutch winner @dunclaurence is out for the same reason. Who next?"
@dadimakesmusic Good luck ! 💕
@dadimakesmusic Best of luck 🍀🍀👍🎶!!
"@dadimakesmusic I'm so sorry to read this, after all the hard work. No one doubts you have been careful, but this is a lottery, an unfair one. I'll vote for you guys this night from Spain. I whis you lots of luck, you're amazing and deserve to be in the final, whether in person or not. 🖤🖤🖤"
"@dadimakesmusic It must be so strange but sit back, relax, have a drink (it's not like you have to sing!) and wait for the votes to roll in x"
@dadimakesmusic Good Luck!!! Voting for you ❤
"@dadimakesmusic Sending you the best vibes from Germany. Alas, vibes only since Germany has already voted on Tuesday. But I believe in your song and in Gagnamagnið!"
"@ExodusWick @dadimakesmusic They were allowed to compete without him, but the group only wanted to perform with everybody. So they decided to use the rehearsals."
@dadimakesmusic Good luck! I love you guys and I hope us Brits get 0 points and you get them all! ♥ 😍
"@dadimakesmusic oh wait, they're using rehearsal footage. I'll still be rooting for you! All the best from the UK"

"@emeraldsroses @Claudsonclouds @dadimakesmusic I mean, unless that's another person, then that's a completley different story hahahahaha"
@dadimakesmusic SO PROUD OF U ❤️
"@emeraldsroses @Claudsonclouds @dadimakesmusic I thought there was one positive test last week, and then negative again, and now positive again?"
@floureite @Claudsonclouds @dadimakesmusic But they all had negative tests until yesterday's test. Wouldn't any tests from when they arrived until then have been positive first?
@dadimakesmusic you'll be great tonight. I know it.
@dadimakesmusic Winners!!!!! https://t.co/zHqmoMe1z9
@dadimakesmusic YOU ARE! ❤️

Fantastic news @dadimakesmusic 😍 #10Years https://t.co/tRbjtdrkRx
"@Claudsonclouds @emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic serious question: wouldn't a positive test following a negative one, indicate it's just an old infection? i remember in cases they check for the viral load to be sure this is not an old infection"
"@dadimakesmusic You carry much good will with you from the Eurovision community. Love gets reflected, it's nice to see someone who gets the mixture of seriousness and levity that the contest has. Whatever the outcome, your place in the pantheon is pretty secure now."

@scott_mills @dadimakesmusic My favourite to win it to be honest. Gutting.
"@neysluvaras @BronwynMunSigra @dadimakesmusic @soundpeturuss nooo, Freyr is a second name, Icelanders generally don't have surnames"
@SchlagerKaty @dadimakesmusic it's not up to them
@dadimakesmusic I think of your Dad and the word “brauð” comes to mind! A great joke he told once in Sicily...🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
@dadimakesmusic He is the father of a legend and a fine man too.  Your Mum is pretty cool too!
"@dadimakesmusic @soundpeturuss Welcome to Twitter, Mr. Freyr! I hope you  have an enjoyable time on it! 🙂"

"@dadimakesmusic You ask, we comply 😗😂"

"@dadimakesmusic Listen. Make sure that Johann, you, Amy and the rest of the band gets retested and do a PCR too. It could be a false alarm. Those rapid tests are not 100% reliable and it could be false positive. Especially if Johann is without symptoms. It’s worth a try at least..."

@hahehmann @gjonstearsoff @dadimakesmusic @victoriageorge_ @GordienkoQueen @ESCGREECE @Samanta_singer @senhitofficial Serbia?????? Girls killed
"Really lovely setup for @dadimakesmusic and company during the recap just now - four members are sitting together in a hotel room, with the two others appearing on iPad screens strategically placed above their teal sweaters. Love it. #Eurovision"
@JamesD1312 @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic I would have loved to see a rematch between them and little big this year.
@scott_mills @dadimakesmusic I was looking forward to seeing their song
"I am so so gutted for you @dadimakesmusic and Gagnamagnið, I love you and am so sorry this has happened especially after the last year 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
NOOOO @dadimakesmusic! NOOOO 😭😭😭😭 Please can we all make sure #Iceland wins #Eurovision this year please?! https://t.co/HFi2AO5b6q
"Glad tidings. The United Kingdom can VOTE in tomorrow’s semi.  Please, lovely Europhiles... vote Iceland.  @dadimakesmusic is the spirit of Eurovision: gifted musician, story teller, hipster in chief with a vocal range big as a mountain range.  Let’s get him to the final. https://t.co/LNIoMIfKmu"
Gutted that @dadimakesmusic won't get the chance to perform live at #Eurovision but I'll be voting for them all the way. https://t.co/383hASvY45
@dadimakesmusic 12 points..... All the points!!!!! Iceland are my Winner!!!!!! ❤️💪🏻
@fckmanet @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic How exciting! Welcome to the full Eurovision experience. Lemme know if you have any more Qs
@TweetMeRyan @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic That makes sense thank you! It’s my first year watching the semi finals
@dadimakesmusic I bet there is a very angry volcano in Iceland this evening.  So unfair.  You get my vote!
"@fckmanet @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic They split them up so that each country only votes in 1 semi-final each, randomly allocated. But for the final everyone gets to vote obviously even the countries that didn't go to the final"
All for @dadimakesmusic https://t.co/UpBTb5E8vT
"Is there anything more 2021 than what's happened to poor Iceland? Big, supportive cheers from the audience for @dadimakesmusic here, and understandably so!  https://t.co/PoBU1gbZvt"
"Iceland get around the absence, with some decent crowd noise and live shots of the arena. Not unduly harmed fortunately #Iceland #dadi #Eurovision"
@dadimakesmusic You will always have my vote 💕
"@dadimakesmusic Since we are not allowed to vote from the Netherlands in the second semi-final, I will ask my friend in Spain to vote for you!"
"@dadimakesmusic What a shame for you guys, but #Iceland still have my vote #Eurovision and I can’t wait for Saturday!"
"🇮🇸 Next up is the much beloved @dadimakesmusic, who of course we now know is using his second rehearsal for the #Eurovision performance.  Vocally and visually ✨ superb ✨  #OpenUp the live blog to read what we think about all tonight’s entries in full 👇  https://t.co/K4bzEZ33sz"
@dadimakesmusic We be voting for you tomorrow. You are all awesome
"@dadimakesmusic I love you, congrats with the baby and also congratulations in advance for winning eurovision 2021. You got my vote"
@TonyTimes2 @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic This post 🙏🏻
@dadimakesmusic I’m so sorry guys😭💔
@dadimakesmusic Hope y’all at least can perform at the final🥺💖
"@JamesD1312 @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic Eurovision rules have long, if not always, stated that a performed song has to have been written within 12 months of the competition. Otherwise you'd get a bunch of covers of big bands"
"@dadimakesmusic Everything will work out ok. As this year's winners, you will perform '10 Years' live at the start of next year's contest in Reykjavik. 😀"
@dadimakesmusic It's been on BBC news that your out it the competition?!? Is it just your not singing live?!?
@dadimakesmusic Big love to you and Gagnamagnið - I believe it’s a sign that you come back again for #Eurovision producing great songs until you get to perform it live! Love your music and use it as inspiration for my music students on how to do it right! ❤️ 🎶
Iceland 🇮🇸 not being able to perform on stage at #Eurovision2021 due to positive #coronavirus cases needs to be the storyline for the next @NetflixFilm @Eurovision film. @dadimakesmusic
@Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic Oh I see. I’ll ask my friend in the UK to vote for you then.
@dadimakesmusic And we will be voting for you!!☎️❤️
"@dadimakesmusic Oh, that's really unfortunate. Hope they'll get well soon! Good luck to all of you!"
@Tigerloon @dadimakesmusic Could end up better - performing under less pressure! 😅
@actualmontaigne @_Go_A_ @dadimakesmusic We were so sad not to have you with us in Europe. Your performance was amazing! 👏👏👏
"@dadimakesmusic You have my vote from Scotland! You will be there on Saturday and if there is any justice in this mad world you will take the crown.   Even if you guys don't, it's still the best I've heard! #EUROVISION"
@kraftwerk can @dadimakesmusic borrow your robots? https://t.co/B5DXGtJt6o
@ExodusWick @dadimakesmusic On the statement it says they won’t perform if the entire group isn’t together so no stand in.
@dadimakesmusic Noooo! Gutted that you won’t get to perform on that stage live on the night. Love your creativity and hopefully we will catch you on tour. Oh and that you win #Eurovision  so then you can then perform it live as winners next year. Wouldn’t that be a moment of serendipity!
This is devastating 😩😭💔 #EUROVISION @dadimakesmusic https://t.co/1AcvtHUwYn
@dadimakesmusic Are you guys performing live or playback of a rehearsal recording?  The best of luck to you guys!  My family and I are huge fans from the US.  Wish we could vote for you.  We'll vote with our hearts!
"@dadimakesmusic I’m so sorry this has happened. Love and peace and chill vibes to you all......  One day, please be the Eurovision act, doing a medley of Eurovision covers a la your concert at home? Pretty please?!"
@dadimakesmusic And we’re still voting for ya 🥰

"@tattosela @JamesD1312 @bonjuruuuuu @TooManyMBrowns @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic The artists could have returned anyway, there's never been a rule against that"
"@JamesD1312 @bonjuruuuuu @CornHoleDavis @TooManyMBrowns @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic They where considering it (the EBU i mean) but ultimately decided to not use the songs, but let the artists return. That´s why we se Dadi, Stefania, Senhit or Natalia Gordienko again this year."
@dadimakesmusic I am so glad Poland is in the same semi and I can vote for you
"@amir_palermo @dadimakesmusic no, still rehearsal performance"
@dadimakesmusic And we will still be voting 🇮🇸🇮🇸
@dadimakesmusic Shit....

"@dadimakesmusic Oh no, I was really looking forward to seeing you guys at Eurovision this year! Think About Things was sure to win last year, I couldn't believe it when it was cancelled. 10 Years is amazing too and we hope you win. UK is rooting for you. 🇬🇧"
"@dadimakesmusic dont worryy, u will wiiiinn anywayyss💚🇮🇸"

This is the most sad thing you will see this Eurovision season... Take care @dadimakesmusic and your entire delegation  https://t.co/q1y49zBPAq
@dadimakesmusic I’ll beg my friends who don’t even watch Eurovision to vote🇮🇸🇮🇸✨
Hey @dadimakesmusic you guys are still my fave Eurovision act and I will definitely vote for you on Saturday ❤️ get healthy and be safe! Takk fyrir for being awesome!
"@dadimakesmusic You're amazing. I'll be supporting you in the Grand Final, because you're a certain qualifier. 12 points 🙂🇬🇧"
@JamesD1312 @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic Same - although 10 Years is an absolute banger as well. @dadimakesmusic definitely knows how to write an earworm!
@dadimakesmusic If you finally can't perform in the eurovision stage... You will have to compose a new song and try to representa Iceland again 💪🏻
@scott_mills @dadimakesmusic Gutted for @dadimakesmusic love them because of you! What a crap year! They'll still have my vote!
At 9pm when we go again for the 2nd run of Semi-Final 2.   I’ll be watching from the Hotel.  A sad day for @dadimakesmusic but his hopes are far from extinguished of the trophy.  He did record a live run at the Arena of Ten Years so he still has a live chance #Eurovision https://t.co/d6EnSTZxyD
"@dadimakesmusic You would have been the winner last year, you were a huge UK fav and would have got our 12 votes. Gutted you won't be playing live &amp; luv to the ill person. Sure you can still win 2021"
"It'd be the most Exceptional Circumstances Win if @dadimakesmusic still wins via a rehearsal recording rather than live performance, due to Exceptional Circumstances, on the most Exceptional Circumstances year because, due to Exceptional Circumstances, last year got cancelled."
@dadimakesmusic Play ja ja ding dong
Newfound respect for @dadimakesmusic  Will still root for Iceland 🇮🇸  #Eurovision https://t.co/qz7s7bHTMs
@bonjuruuuuu @CornHoleDavis @TooManyMBrowns @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic I think in the event of Covid anyone can make any exception they want. Society over the last two years has proved this. But it is what is
"So sad for @dadimakesmusic and still hope they make the Grand Final and do well, such a great song. In other news, Fire Saga are about make an appearance singing the full version of Volcano Man #Eurovision #ESC2021 #Eurovision2021 https://t.co/cGtheNt5Ex"
@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Damn it. Absolutely gutted you guys don't get to close off your story on the night. What a crappy end to an even crappier year.

"@dadimakesmusic You cant call it being carefull if you come to a county where they spread the virus to get herd immunity. And let public watch inside without masks or distance, in a high risk country like the Netherlands.  But take care, and get well soon."

"@dadimakesmusic We're still looking forward your performance, we know all the hard work you put in💖💖 Thank you gagnamagnið 🥺🥺"
@dadimakesmusic You have a curse
@dadimakesmusic Did you by any chance appear in a music video by the Icelandic band named Churchhouse Creepers?
@dadimakesmusic Such a shame you didn’t at least get to perform a jury rehearsal.
@dadimakesmusic And very good you were too.  Sorry about today's news but I'm guessing you smashed it at the rehearsal - so I'm really looking forward to seeing the performance 😍Nx
"I'm so crushed @dadimakesmusic won't be performing at #Eurovision, but I really hope to go to their concert soon! Come to Italy, we want to see you and we have great food too!!"
@hankgreen Has he heard @dadimakesmusic's new song? I've been wondering this for weeks now
@CornHoleDavis @TooManyMBrowns @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic Because it was cancelled. Didn’t get the air time it deserved
@dadimakesmusic They should delay the Eurovision to wait for you.
@JamesD1312 @TooManyMBrowns @Hujugtctg @dadimakesmusic How's it unfair? Same rule for everyone. I did love last year's song though
"Let's stream @dadimakesmusic &amp; Co's songs for Jóhann's recovery, my heart goes out for them now 🙏❤️ 🇮🇸 https://t.co/tFySw9zIU3"

@dadimakesmusic @Eurovision Isn’t there a way for a blood test to really know if he’s positive or not? 😭
@dadimakesmusic @ACapacityToGeek  oh no!
"@dadimakesmusic Sheesh, Australia lost many votes because of this, it's so much inferior then a live show, hope the recording will be out of this world."

@Fernan_Otero @dadimakesmusic So am I as many of their fans. Doing another test can either give a negative or another positive. I heard from someone in health care that around 11% of tests give false positives.
Ohhh that’s rubbish news 😭😭   Health first (ALWAYS) but still so heartbroken for Dadi Freyr and the team… but the ICONIC group pushes on… can’t wait to see the rehearsal recording tomorrow night!    #Eurovision #Iceland #DadiFreyr https://t.co/4hkOTN8ggX

"@dadimakesmusic It's very sad that you won't perform live on the stage 🙁 Stay healthy and good luck, we love you 🙏🤞❤️"
"@Claudsonclouds @dadimakesmusic Most likely they won't be able to because of someone gets a positive test they are required to quarantine for 5 days, test again and if negative they can leave quarantine. Looks like if they qualify we'll only see the recorded rehearsal."

@dadimakesmusic So much love for all of you We will support you no matter the circumstances 😥😥💕💕💕💕
@dadimakesmusic Stay safe. Hopefully you can perform in the final on Saturday
@Popfictionbiz @dadimakesmusic but at least apparently it was a really good rehearsal so. fingers crossed for my country. still a damn shame.
@dadimakesmusic Welcome to the great medical field experiment that is the Netherlands! We give the virus free rein and see what happens.
@dadimakesmusic So so sorry 😭 All fingers crossed for Saturday! And of course we support you either way 🇮🇸
"@Popfictionbiz @dadimakesmusic No, I mean the tape will be used tomorrow becausethey def can't be there tomorrow. But if they make it through, the tape will be used again on Saturday. That's why meh, because then it'd just be literally the same performance twice. And that's a shame."
"@dadimakesmusic It's sad to hear this 😭  Get well soon everyone, and a virtual hug to Jói..The poor must be suffering emotionally with that feeling of guilt 😥"

"@dadimakesmusic The Netherlands is a herd immunity country, and mostly does not try to prevent infection or test for it adequately. I'm very sorry we did this to your team :-(  It's best to assume any Dutch people around you under 70 could be infected, and keep a distance and stay masked."

@actualmontaigne @_Go_A_ @dadimakesmusic we love u 🥺💗
"my favourite part of being in eurovision this year, apart from all the love and support of the fans, has been performing alongside such an impressive roster of acts, esp @_Go_A_, @dadimakesmusic, manizha, and the roop, who are such clear-headed &amp; thoughtful artists"
"Watched #EUROVISION with my parents tonight. One of the silly little highlights has to be when the uk hosts were talking to @dadimakesmusic and my mother pipes up with “Hey that’s the guy with the sweaters! He’s cool, I like him!” Well sounds like Daði has a new fan.😂🇮🇸"
"@takemoredetours @Eurovision @dadimakesmusic Haha, no worries! I’d be horrified too if I thought Iceland hadn’t got through! 😄"
"@jameshoggarth @dadimakesmusic @Hot_Chip 1 condition of entry should be that all the songs are included in a compilation album (each artist can retain ""singles"" rights and rights to include it elsewhere). I feel like that could be a decent seller despite the decline in physical sales"
@RiaElizabeth94 @takemoredetours @Eurovision @dadimakesmusic LMFAO 😄
"Can’t wait to see Iceland performing on Thursday, voting and rooting for you to win!🇮🇸✨ @dadimakesmusic https://t.co/NIdNsRrEuG"
No. I will not be joining the #Eurovision discourse on the tl.  Yes. I will be supporting @dadimakesmusic 🇮🇸 on Saturday.  No. I will not be commenting further at this time.
"Wow... #eurovision... a couple of surprises there! Shocked that the newest eurovision country didn't make it through after a decent performance. Now it's all about getting @dadimakesmusic through on Thursday! See you on Thursday, #EduVision! https://t.co/MVANJ9J920"
@dadimakesmusic Think the UK loves you
@takemoredetours @Eurovision @dadimakesmusic They weren’t in semi final 1. They will be performing on Thursday in semi final 2.
@CurtJackson666 @dadimakesmusic Hahaha! Love it. Waiting for our test results....
I actually have a soft spot for the Lithuanian 🇱🇹 entry - shades of Iceland’s 🇮🇸 @dadimakesmusic entry that never was last year (which was ace - especially the @Hot_Chip remix) #Eurovision
@takemoredetours @Eurovision @dadimakesmusic Iceland is in second semi final
@dadimakesmusic Our 6 year old just came down for a drink and noticed you. She was very happy. Good luck on Thursday. PS I'm in the UK you get our vote we couldn't vote tonight.
@samerfarha @dadimakesmusic There's an eyeglass store near Herald Square called EUROVISION and no one understands why I laugh every time I see the sign.
@dadimakesmusic And I saw you 👀
Eurovision are so terrible at drawing this shit out. Now waiting for Thursday and @dadimakesmusic’s ascent to the top!
@dadimakesmusic Saw you. 👀💪💪
@dadimakesmusic you love to see it
@dadimakesmusic Thanks for trying to get Arny into the shot!
@dadimakesmusic The UK loves you! @dadimakesmusic
@dadimakesmusic Thank u for being on TV we loved it
@dadimakesmusic And the best of luck to you Dadi from the Uk. Smash it on Thursday. 👌👌👌👌
"@dadimakesmusic Hello from the UK!   I was looking forward to seeing you in London, but the gig was cancelled ☹️. Hopefully I'll get to see you play music live in the future. Until then, I'll watch your videos on YouTube.   Good Luck on Thursday!"
"@dadimakesmusic I saw you! So proud. (I am the assistant to the Icelandic Consul of Manchester, so I’m VERY INVESTED in an Island win) x"
@dadimakesmusic Quite happy to see you😍 https://t.co/31InL7L9ys

@dadimakesmusic Best of luck to you! 💙🇳🇴
@seanmescal @dadimakesmusic No think about things will forever be iconic and the 2020 winner in my eyes I adore it
"A fun (and simple enough for me), official Daði and Gagnamagnið @dadimakesmusic 🇮🇸 video game. Filling the gaps while waiting for the @Eurovision Song Contest 🤗 https://t.co/u7oLAMhx4X https://t.co/6bdhAzCzfc"
@seanmescal @dadimakesmusic Already have been before actually when I tweeted about think about things being my Spotify top song of 2020 🤣
"Look, sure, this is all great but now I know @dadimakesmusic is back representing Iceland anything else is just filling time #eurovision"
@dadimakesmusic Gangi þér vel for @Eurovision ...  #Eurovision2021 @bbceurovision  whatever happens you were 2020 #EURO2020  winner for sure x https://t.co/uue7PgtZ5y
"Ah yeah like the standard is class in this semi final I must say, but at the same time none of these people are Daði Freyr and Gagnamagnið 😍😍 can’t wait to see them in the second semi final @dadimakesmusic"
If there was any justice @dadimakesmusic would be given an automatic final place this year and also crowned the “unofficial”#Eurovision 2020 winner.
@Mystic_Pip @dadimakesmusic @bbceurovision I must look out for that!
"@InezvKorlaar @dadimakesmusic You should be ❤️ They’ve done a great job, especially after everyone’s crushing disappointment at last year’s understandable cancellation. I can’t wait to hear all about your experience on Monday! Clear the team meeting agenda. We need to hear everything! Amanda’s going to watch!"
"@Lshire_Laird @dadimakesmusic @bbceurovision Love love love.... I follow his YouTube channel... His Eurovision night, where he does his own version of Eurovision songs from the past is legendary..."
@AislingBrophy @dadimakesmusic And this year's song is about his wife! Adorable!
"Finding out @dadimakesmusic song  for last year's #Eurovision was about his baby not his love interest has been such an ""oh yeahh"" moment for me. Makes total sense. 10/10 can relate."
❤ @dadimakesmusic can't wait #Iceland @Eurovision
"@dadimakesmusic is just cool, I cannot wait to see him in Bristol #Eurovision"
"Would probs marry @dadimakesmusic, tbh #Eurovision"
#Eurovision Aw @dadimakesmusic BBC don’t deserve this interview. I’m sure they’re fine.

@bbceurovision Loving the show so far but honestly just waiting for Thursday and @dadimakesmusic 🙌🙌
@ThatWriterGal @dadimakesmusic @dadimakesmusic can come second to The Roop
"After @dadimakesmusic rather catchy tune from 2020 could have been a winner,i hope they are not having to qualify for the finals this year #Eurovision"
@AlexTaylorNews I already love your tweets. Now I'm going to love them more. Iceland to win btw @dadimakesmusic

@emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic @ESCRadio1 True 😂😂
@teeramissoo @dadimakesmusic @ESCRadio1 Hence the quotation marks 😂
@emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic @ESCRadio1 I mean...they are pretty mainstream genres
#NewProfilePic for #Eurovision and of course @dadimakesmusic !  #Iceland @Eurovision https://t.co/DYbIkMlpMa
"@teeramissoo @dadimakesmusic @ESCRadio1 I've got no idea. Perhaps ESC songs aren't ""mainstream"" enough for the stations."
"@dadimakesmusic Good health to you all! We believe everything will be just fine, can't wait to see you on stage"
it is officially #Eurovision week aka. time to change my profile picture @dadimakesmusic 🇮🇸 🇮🇸 🇮🇸 https://t.co/XeKWHFvxEP
@emeraldsroses @dadimakesmusic @ESCRadio1 Hmm. I mean obviously here we've heard Måneskin on the radio but that's largely because they are the winners of Sanremo. Why don't countries encourage local/international media to promote their songs more?
@teeramissoo I haven't heard the Dutch song on the radio either. The most we got was @dadimakesmusic on the radio three times since March. If it weren't for @ESCRadio1 I wouldn't have heard many songs from this ESC.
@dadimakesmusic 🤞 sending love X x x x
