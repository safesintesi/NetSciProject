Oops I probably should have tagged him @gjonstearsoff 😅
"This explains how 🇨🇭 won the jury vote. Wow. Also, good reminder of why we need to be careful with what we hear from the press room during live streams. Most are not music experts, or have musical education yet they get to comment and judge vocals. #Eurovision #GjonsTears #openup https://t.co/nADl6BJI5g"
@gjonstearsoff Awesome song! Now listening it 24/7:P

"This voice. What an amazing talent. To me, #GjonsTears and @L0oiic (2015, Belgium) are the most amazing talents during the last years of #Eurovision. I still try to comprehend.  https://t.co/msu2thwsYB"
"@spunkster69 @Eurovision @bbceurovision Seems it s new buzz ! Thx for sharing this because I disliked (euphemism) this vulgar italian group So=&gt; i didnt attend to their victoire  Finally allthough i am french i'd like #GjonsTears ""#Tout_l_univers"" from #Switzerland would have won #Eurovision2021 https://t.co/NlQh73L53j"
"@RichardWalters @gjonstearsoff Wouldn't go so far as to say robbed as I was also a big fan of Italy, but I agree that it was absolutely gorgeous!"
Switzerland were robbed - that @gjonstearsoff song is INCREDIBLE
"The more I listen to @gjonstearsoff at Eurovision, the more I love it. Sensational song. What a voice 😍"
#GjonsTears  - #ToutlUnivers - #Switzerland 🇨🇭 - Official Music Video - ... https://t.co/MIvUka9KoG via @YouTube  This is just stuck in my head... #epic song... should have won #Eurovision ... great video too @gjonstearsoff
"I am so happy that @gjonstearsoff won 3rd place @Eurovision! Such a beautiful performance - super well done! I really liked Italy’s, Finland’s, and France’s entries, too 😊"

@gjonstearsoff This song was my favorite! ♥️ Since yesterday I’m listening the whole time to this song!  (I don’t know why but I see no difference between you and @MLGamer7 😂)
@gjonstearsoff Wanted you to win 👏😊
🚨SAD NEWS🚨 last @escFanTV show! We are gonna talk about the @Eurovision final! tonight at 9 CET @thisismaneskin @gjonstearsoff @Babpravi on #youtube don’t mis it! #escfantv #declercqeline #declercqelineblog #elinedeclercq https://t.co/3mi7CGml6e
#Switzerland #SUI #GjonsTears and #France #FRA #BarbaraPravi absolutely slayed the competition this year at #Eurovision #Eurovision2021 @Eurovision. I didn’t understand the lyrics but I felt the song and music in a euphoric way that I’d never felt before. Well done! ❤️❤️❤️
Brilliant @gjonstearsoff 🇨🇭 at @Eurovision 2021! He is in the Top 3! Congrats for this superb #performance and thе marvelous #song: “Tout l'univers” (The whole universe)! Enjoy it again: 👉 https://t.co/SoOCIzdeNr https://t.co/8JXKuF9i9m
@JetmirRamaj1996 @IceWind86585905 @ParmelinG @gjonstearsoff In 2010 shakiri a great talent 🤔maybe ... this great talent failed in South Africa.
Why does @gjonstearsoff not have more followers?
"Eurovision winners: 1. The city of Rotterdam  2. #nikkietutorials  3. Me...because I discovered #GjonsTears 4. And of course, Gjon ... winner in my heart!"
@JetmirRamaj1996 @IceWind86585905 @ParmelinG @gjonstearsoff Nobody knows where the Nati would be without Xhaka Shaqiri etc . We see that the team does not fly high.  Remember South Africa 2010 Shaqiri Behrami Bunjaku. A shame
"@MaggieM91300507 @Eurovision First of all,I’m not crying.They liked me so much as I said.But apart of this sniff,I was already upset because of the lack of respect they had while #GjonsTears was speaking.I was already angry and I didnt see the “sniff video”.So whatever,being disrespectful it's ugly enough 👋🏽"

"like my french is pretty bad so before i actually looked up the lyrics i had no idea what he was singing except something about the universe, but i still absolutely fell in love with it and @gjonstearsoff’s voice the first time i heard it and i’ll definitely keep listening to him"
@mikasounds @thisismaneskin @ManuHellAgnelli @Ferraguzzo @xfactoritalia @gjonstearsoff was also good🎶🎶

.@gjonstearsoff is the winner in my heart ❤️ His performance was out of this world #Eurovision https://t.co/4H3Vwsp5MM
@srfesc @SRF @gjonstearsoff @SRGSSR The best  singer of this song contest He must be the winner. I love it. remember the voice  in France   wonderful rocket-man(EltonJOHN)  and under pressure(David BOWIE)) Sublime singer. Amazing.
"We need @tommcrae for UK's #Eurovision2022 entry. Already has a following in Europe (+cousins in Australia for votes), music style not unlike France's @Babpravi, and the vocal range of Switzerland's @gjonstearsoff. Dad dance moves and onesie merch like @dadimakesmusic optional."
@ESCShowcase @ForestFM @CiaranUT @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic @gjonstearsoff Will definitely be tuning in. The UK needs to rethink it's strategy.  This year we had lazy staging (what worked for Michael Ball in 1992 won't work 30 years later) and we are relying on the glory days of the late 1970s. James did the best he could with a challenging situation.

"@MusicomeNews @gjonstearsoff Great voice, great song. Unfortunately a song that is too deep for a context like Eurovision. He would probably stand a better chance to make it to the top 5 if the refrain was more ""dance music"" even though that would screw the song. Then again, I'm so not an expert in music 🙃"

"@TeamAlbanians @gjonstearsoff I’m in Tirana and will vote Gjon, cause I can’t vote Albania. But don’t forget, it’s Albania that represents the Albanians. Gjon represents Switzerland. When are we Albanians going to think reasonably just for once?"

"@Deni_Hoxha @gjonstearsoff How do you know? What about the players that play with 🇦🇱, have they all paid 100k? Is Bajrami paying 100k to play with 🇦🇱 when 🇨🇭says they are loosing one of their biggest talents. Certainly you do come out a bit wanting for a Harvard guy, or maybe they're just dropping standard"
@TeamAlbanians @gjonstearsoff Tonight  VOTE # 2 🇦🇱 Vote for Anxxhela
@TeamAlbanians @gjonstearsoff Why would I vote for Switzerland? I’m Albanian
"@Rudi_Dauti @Deni_Hoxha @TeamAlbanians @gjonstearsoff Maybe this guy us saying the truth ,  but all those guys like Shaqiri and Co , they were lying to justify themselves choosing Switzerland  t"
"@Deni_Hoxha @TeamAlbanians @gjonstearsoff Bullshit  Shaqiri was lying in everything he said about those money asking  Our federation asked him to cone and he did not wanted Almost all those players who played for Switzerland were saying this kind of bullshit ,  lying to justify their participating with 🇨🇭"
"@TeamAlbanians @marxlipaist @gjonstearsoff Oh yes, I will vote 20 times for Gjon from Germany 🇩🇪! God bless... #Eurovision2021"
@SusanneSeimel @gjonstearsoff Meine weiteren Favoriten sind #UKR #ITA and #ALB #openup and lets have a great evening!! #Eurovision

"3. @gjonstearsoff's ""Tout l'univers"" is the other song I'd give more than a fighting chance. @celinedion won in 1988 representing Switzerland with a French-language song – as of now, the most recent win for both nation and language. Coincidence?  https://t.co/iHQvpgqu6d"
@hddtuibcs4 @TeamAlbanians @gjonstearsoff Vote 16 times for anxhela since the rest of Europe will vote for Gjon
"TONIGHT: VOTE 11 👐🇨🇭🇦🇱🇽🇰  Although both Albania and Switzerland are in the final, we encourage you to vote for Switzerland since @GjonsTearsoff is one of the favorites to win and your vote would make a difference. #eurovision https://t.co/L4LdWEINSw"

"Omg @gjonstearsoff that vocal was amazing, I can only dream having a vocal range as good as yours #Eurovision #OpenUp"
"#switzerland: #gjonstears sings Ok during this #juryshow. Everybody seems to be more or less off-key tonight. The high voice of Gjon resonates well, and is still impressive. He can do better, we know, we have heard it before."

No tears for Gjon.  Vocally perfect.  His range is incredible.  People may question the staging but really you don’t need to this is a song that could still contend Saturday. #Eurovision @gjonstearsoff https://t.co/AfMUpfnwMY

@srfesc @Eurovision @SRF @gjonstearsoff @SRGSSR such a ray of sunshine
"@SaarkinCho @srfesc @SRF @Eurovision @gjonstearsoff @SRGSSR Totally agree with you ! The 1st rehearsal was almost perfect, but the totally unnatural moves of pseudo rapper and the hideous choreography ruined the whole performance at the 2nd rehearsal. Gjon deserves so much better for his fabulous song. Baisers d'un fan français 🇨🇵❤️🇨🇭"
@mylenefarmer this reminds me of a #MyleneFarmer song #GjonsTears @gjonstearsoff @Eurovision
