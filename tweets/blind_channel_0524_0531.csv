"@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN I agree that BC has different sound that LP but i dont agree that BC trended because someone felt it sounded LP. It trended 'cause ESC and' cause BC is fucking great. Their own sound is perfection. Perfectly build songs, amazing layers and drops. 🤷‍♀️ BC is One of a kind."

"@eppahtabem_ @BlindChannelFIN And this point of view I do like. And don’t know if you take recommendations but if you do, I recommend to check out their The Hunting Party album from 2014, it might be doesn’t sound like HT but is still pretty heavy"
Yoooo goodnight stream   #blindchannel #eurovision  https://t.co/wNuwXbDQkk
@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN I apreciate that. I admit I love HT and Meteora but cant even name their other albuns as it completly lost me. But I also believe artists should be free to create and evolve however they feel like. Stay genuine. And it sure wasnt a mistake as they gathered a lot of new fans.
"@BlindChannelFIN Tics bought, just on time🔥🇫🇮❤️"
"@eppahtabem_ @BlindChannelFIN Idk man, just read through the replies here that I’ve missed earlier, and yours somehow looked like one from old school LP fans that allow HT and Meteora alike sounds only and think that everything after this albums was a mistake. Guess I misunderstood you, I apologize for that"
@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN Wow. Where have you read that in my words? They can play whatever they want.. however they want.. They can play folklore for all I care as long as they are happy doing it. And im free to like it or not. Just like you are. Why all the hate man? Chill out.
"@eppahtabem_ @BlindChannelFIN According to you they should’ve kept making music in the same style just because people expect them to? And then became another band that is being hated for not changing their sound? No thanks, that’s not what Linkin Park is about, sad that it’s quite difficult for you to grasp."
@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN Its a reference on how their music changed a lot from their first 2 albuns onwards. Like they forgot their own sound. Sad that I have to lay it all out there for you to grasp.
"@eppahtabem_ @BlindChannelFIN Yeah, sure he doesn’t remember how his own music sounds like, lmao"

@Rankakustannus @CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin Yes agree although I don’t know much of LP music other than the hits
@loveeuromusic @CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin We saw also lot of comparisons to Hollywood Undead and Bring Me The Horizon. We used the same mixing engineer and there could be similar sounds but style is still quite different.

"@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN Lazy to say it’s sounds like LP due to 2 vocalists, I can see influences. But there are a lot of Nu Metal influences in their music Limp Bizkit and Adema to name a few. I’m loving Violent Pop atm. Great band"
@loveeuromusic @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin We germans jsut sned crab always sadly... ever we have great bands  Like https://t.co/OC2pcW0bxR https://t.co/ztGaX7RX8a https://t.co/ThcprmCaLZ https://t.co/SnZgt2iQEl https://t.co/cH76s5dod9
@CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin I am not usually a pop fan and don’t pay attention to chart music and never have so please link your playlist when done. I love rock too
@loveeuromusic @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin Maybe you start with some pop qs uk is more focused on this to learn a little bit about artists. I working on playlist on youtube and I often post international music from evey gere even I qm home at metal and rock
@CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin Well there is a reason the top three of Eurovision won and in their own language. The top four were my favourite and @thisismaneskin being my absolute favourite. I am just so excited about their career and want to see them live. I hate to say it but the Uk was the weakest song
@Rankakustannus @CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin I am guilty of that a bit. Only part of the music though. Vocally and lyrically they were nothing a like. Just similar genre. But it would be like comparing every rock band or every country artist and so on
@loveeuromusic @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin Stoped supporting usa and uk artists   the world is full with music
"@loveeuromusic @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin Well then you are part of the small group. I had  to see on twitter how bad european music is that they should  sing english, and why they like rock and other bullshit. Uk qnd usa are anyway the standart I cant even say how tierd I am of uk and usa nusic  industry I already"
@CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin I would love some artists recommendations if you have any?
"@loveeuromusic @CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin People making this comparison just have no clue about this kind of music, Linkin Park happens to be the only band they know."
@CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin Listening hence why I have yesterday started a review site for European music. I am still on a high from the whole event
@CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin I am loving the talent that is in Europe. I was just saying how I cannot believe we don’t have many European artists in our CHarts. I hope this Eurovision changes that as we have a lot of the acts in our top 40 itunes chart right now. The talent was insane and I cannot stop....
@loveeuromusic @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN @thisismaneskin The point is usa and uk have to much say in the european market its time to get our market back i am tierd usa uk ignoranz and aroganz. They insulting us they insulting our artist but want to make money here. Time for european entertainment union
@CatyMoon4 @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN Yes I can understand that. Destiny couldn’t avoid being compared to Lizzo. Some said @thisismaneskin are similar to The Darkness which I couldn’t understand at all as they are nothing alike
"Awesome to see @thisismaneskin @dadimakesmusic Tix, Gjon’s Tears, @_Go_A_ , Barbara Pravi, @BlindChannelFIN, Tusse, The Roop and Elena Tsagkrinou all on the UK top 40 Itunes charts. @Eurovision is taking over and I love it!!!"
@BlindChannelFIN @Eurovision Fucking wankers🤮
@loveeuromusic @BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN Ita annyoing that everyone compare forgeiner  artist's from outside eof usa and uk constantly  with usa and uk artists for real as if usa and uk would be standart....
@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN Thanks for sharing this. Blind Channel are probably happy about this too as bands and artists don’t really like to be compared and want their own unique stamp so this is pretty cool to hear
"@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN I don't understand the need to constantly compare musicians (and artists in general) like that.  ""Your work reminds me of [this artist]"" always feels weird to me, unless the artist has said that they're trying to evoke a certain vibe."
@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN WE NEED @mikeshinoda @BlindChannelFIN COLLABORATION! It's one of the biggest dreams for Blind Channel and let's face it - it would be epic!!!
"@BroodingAnanas @BlindChannelFIN Wow, that's Amazing, Congratulations 👏👍❤"

"@BlindChannelFIN @Eurovision I've been listening to the entries again and I can't understand the juries that didn't vote for you. The song is varied but well balanced, multilayered and has a wonderful beat. There's no musical issues that could have reduced the points 🤷‍♀️ Beats me. Amazing work guys!"
