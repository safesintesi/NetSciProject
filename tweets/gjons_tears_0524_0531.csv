"@jamiecullum just pondering your thoughts on @gjonstearsoff who came 3rd in Eurovision this year - I’ve gone down a rabbit hole with his back catalogue and I find him a precocious talent and would adore it if he kept on a Jazz direction. A collab, now that would be something! 😁"

People get upset over the drug allegations but the bullying and offensive comments targeting #Destiny and #gjonstears because they did well with the music expert vote are fine apparently. Selective outrage as always. My thoughts to 2 great artists ! #eurovision #eurovisiongr

@gjonstearsoff This is by far the best performance. It should be an honour for @Eurovision to have this artist present..should be by far the winner of the Eurovision 2021...
"@Eurovision @EurovisionSwiss @gjonstearsoff Gjonns should be the winner, simply because it is the best song, the best voice, the best performance. This is from an artistic point of view, an artist can easily understand that Gjon was by far the best."

"When asked about his opinion on #maneskin , he said they were ""marvelous"", but that his favourites were #BarbaraPravi and #gjonstears . Gjon especially has been a huge discovery for him; at some point he was feeling nervous and Blas went to his dressing room to comfort him"

@gjonstearsoff Loved your entry - so captivating - and lyrically poetic - for me it was the winning song.  I still can’t stop listening to it.
I am always extra when I am watching the #EurovisionSongContest2021 who was your favorite? Mine was definitely #switzerland !! &lt;3 #GjonsTears https://t.co/rfpRgvE6LO
"Very happy about Italy's victory, but obviously the real winner was the angelic voice of Gjon's Tears 👼🎶  WE NEED AN ALBUM. NOW. 💙  #Eurovision #Switzerland #GjonsTears #ToutlUnivers #goosebumps"
"For me it's a musical mystery, which sounds in deep of my soul #Eurovision2021 #EUROVISION #GjonsTears https://t.co/ScBwUTyGs5"
"After the show, @gjonstearsoff came to tell @HooverphonicOff that he’s open for a collaboration. That would be awesome right?  🎥 @een  #Eurovision https://t.co/vbLsVXDhth"
I’m obsessed with #GjonsTears ❤️ https://t.co/NsztRNLllZ
"What a very solid finish for #Switzerland🇨🇭 with its best #Eurovision result since 1993, leaving Rotterdam in 3rd at 432 points thanks to #GjonsTears' take on #ToutlUnivers. A big 👍👍 for this outstanding outcome.  #ESC2021 #OpenUp https://t.co/0HV5LToAMP"
@gjonstearsoff You were just incredible. Repondez-Moi makes me feel so much even though I understand nothing to little. It's deep you were Scotlands and my true winner🙏♥️♥️ #Eurovision2021
