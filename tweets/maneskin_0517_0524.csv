@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Uk should have had some points. I think the voting was fixed as usual.
"So stupid to think #damianodavid would do drugs on national television. Just don't say that. If he wasn't a rock star, you wouldn't even think that so.."

@Esc_Iep @Traceva001 There's NO justification for a world wide social media fake drug assumption accuse and the bad reputation you publicly built around a person - in this case a guy of 20 y-old. NO justification. That's nothing to do with a silly soccer game or whatever. Waiting apologies. #maneskin

@PunkDavy @CPicinotti @SmileMyBeauties @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I think you need a bit of a fact checking: since 2003 the UK finished last. The issue is that you have great music/singers but none of them goes to the ESC... https://t.co/LZpJ56piNp
"Watched the @Eurovision last night, and honestly for me, it had the best group of songs yet.  I’d say that @thisismaneskin and @BlindChannelFIN were probably my top two acts. Had both their songs stuck in my head all day. 🤘🏻"

"Okay now I need to learn italian, thanks #maaneskin #maaneskinofficialfanclub #Eurovision2021"
@saylahachey My mind went blank as I read this question.   I'd been listening to #Eurovision all afternoon and #maneskin has been stuck in my head 🤷‍♂️
"@sonoletizia @FrantzLebourge1 @thisismaneskin @Eurovision Idk why they act like that, they wanted France to win but there is no joy winning over a scandal and  anyway your performance was much better and original than us...  But for sure you must be proud, me and my gf have already download their song lol"
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Happy for Italy but completely disappointed with the winner. Italy deserves a way better winner. You, italians, have a long tradition of good singers and now, this? I don't get it😶"
@domscottoncandy @thisismaneskin WOOOOW HEY

@ANONGODESS @truth_t3ll3r_ @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Yeah and most other performances were imitating mediocre contemporary american pop. What's your point?
"@FilipOrvik @Ant_Cirrincione @thisismaneskin @Eurovision To be honest, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are almost dialects of one and same language.  Swedish and Norwegian people understand each other with small difficulty and Norwegian people can read Danish (and vice versa) quite easily. Skåne people understand Danish with no problem"

"@ANONGODESS @Monica24338766 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Finnland was good but the lyrics were kinda cringy. ""Ooh we don't give a fuck so we're gonna flip everyone off... "" It's kind of unimaginative. They were my second favorite though. I'm always down for a good rock show:D"

@playboygrandee @thisismaneskin Everyone has different tastes rock isn’t for everyone ☺️
"@sonoletizia @FrantzLebourge1 @thisismaneskin @Eurovision Even French would spit on him, dont listen to those mf and again, u deserved that win, it was Amazing"
and award for the most attractive band goes to …. MÅNESKIN!!!  #Eurovision #maneskin #måneskin https://t.co/4SFlq3YXdr
@bexopinionated @artemiseea @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Oof you clearly know nothing about music. It's easy to let someone lay down some boring overproduced musical track. Many artists had great voices but they could have done more with the song. Just because a song isn't a ballad doesn't mean it doesn't require talent. We need more🤘
"@salvininonbloc1 @FilipOrvik @thisismaneskin @Eurovision Å appears only in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.  It represents stretched ""O"" sound"
Italian works so well as rock lyrics....obsessed with @thisismaneskin!
@Efeeney73 @IAmWSmirat @Eurovision @thisismaneskin people with taste
@albeauvaischiva @Eurovision @thisismaneskin @EurovisionF2 @France2tv @RaiUno @RaiDue @RaiTre Maneskin and EBU should sue this racist guy
"@Lauren_Jones190 @alexalilac @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Great excuse england... Most of the pop songs were just forgettable and uncreative, especially englands. Maneskin stood out and had so much fun on stage and the song is just freaking amazing!!!"
@acomincioli1 @AThesenvitz @Eclipse_Ocelot @Eurovision @thisismaneskin At the time I posted it there was no explanation to be found so no there wasnt. Now there is and as Eurovision also confirmed it we do now.

"@AThesenvitz @Eclipse_Ocelot @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Yeah, I know what his explanation was and what Eurovision said. Also Im not saying that he was doing drugs. I was saying we don't know what happened."

@nigritha_ @thisismaneskin @chetempochefa I'm late but thank you so much 🤍
@APadders @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Most of eurovision is shit. Pop is the least creative genre out there. Its nice to see some rock. I also liked Finnland. But it was just a little too cringe and poppy to be as impressive as Italy. I mean even Italy was kind of poppy in my eyes but it was definitely a step up
@camizanne @P1Bliss @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Materazzi confessed that he did. What else?
@thisismaneskin that’s it. that’s the tweet.
I am actually thinking about learning Italian because of @thisismaneskin and if they are actually going on tour I better hurry up. Also I am an amateur photographer can I please take picture of any show you will have around Slovakia 🤘🤘🤘🙏
I finally understood that Damiano David from #maneskin resembles Jesse Rutherford. Anyone else?

@RCArmitage @Eurovision @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi My highlight was James Newman's wholehearted embracing of scoring no points at all. What a legend.  I didn't care for the winning song; for good Eurovision rock I would go back to Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah  - I loved that. We should get Queen with Adam Lambert to represent us.

"@olivietta @Chiggsy02 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin If u feel like ur talking to a wall then obv ur the one with the issues here.

#EUROVISION  1. Damiano of @thisismaneskin didn't snort anything. 2. UK's 0 wasn't political; people just really didn't like the song/show. 3. Insert next twittersphere brouhaha with a stink of conspiracy: probably also a nothingburger.

"@snydeshop @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin This isn't an ""oh i have an opinion"" thing. This shit could sabotage the band. Also the way you've drawn your conclusions are based on NOTHING. How many times do I have to repeat it. If you have nothing to back it up then save your useless conclusion."

"@sophiefotini @willyleeadams @thisismaneskin I mean, George Michael would have beaten any country any time... but would also never have entered the Eurovision Song Contest no matter how much you paid him. And that’s the issue - we could enter Adele &amp; we’d come in the bottom 5.   Good to chat Eurovision with another fan! 🌍"
so I tried to put clear varnish on them and totally destroyed the Ace of Spades - will do Zitti e buoni from #maneskin instead
@Lorenzo96361402 @thisismaneskin @chetempochefa thank u sm!
"@adamdowling @willyleeadams @thisismaneskin This was the worse Eurovision EVER! EDITH PIAF is rolling in her grave, so would Ozzy if he were dead! Well, the jury is still out on that one!

"@CindyConde97 @TonyAguilarOfi @thisismaneskin No, the song was actually not a rock song, it was rap! Mixed genre! It was not understandable why they didn't sing in English which is the universal language of rock. I would say it was 80% rap! And bad rap!"

Final #Eurovision thoughts. Congratulations to everyone at @Eurovision @avrotros for delivering the show. Well done to @RaiUno &amp; @thisismaneskin for winning. Good luck in 2022. As for @bbceurovision where do we go from here? The ratings are great but won’t be coming last yearly!

@spooksaur @Eurovision @thisismaneskin My main point was that voting isn't  based purely on the songs. It's political   or voting for your neighbouring country. The best songs don't always get the best votes like every year.

"I think that if Italy hadn’t won there wouldn’t have been all this polemic. It’s just a way for France to try to win (confirming themselves as whiners, not accepting the defeat).

It was a Dutch viewer who pointed out the sequence and the French public gave Italy 10 points. So what's with the hatred and 2006 nostalgia guys? #Eurovision #maneskin
"I appreciate the fact that @thisismaneskin did sing their original lyrics in their winner's performance, bringing 'coglioni' and 'cazzo' to unsuspecting listeners.    #nuts #bolts #checazzo #Eurovision"
@DjangoF3 @thisismaneskin @Eurovision for what? taking fragments of a broken glass on the floor? ask to take a drug test at the end of the contest because of the memes on Twitter just to show no one of them are on drugs? what is the shame?

@bbceurovision @grahnort Was it really necessary to be so snide @ condescending about #ITA the winners? Just because it may not to be your taste doesn’t mean you need to be rude about them. Personally I think it was refreshing to hear something decent for a change! @thisismaneskin 🤘🏻
@Eurovision @bbceurovision  🙌🙋‍♂️Rotterdam!!! what a brilliant event!! 🇳🇱 Congratulations @thisismaneskin  🇮🇹 @Babpravi 🇫🇷 was my favourite. Sorry about Mandy Holden 🤦‍♂️ 🇬🇧 (what a lot of flags all together) ❤️ 🇪🇺
this was exactly my reaction when they won #Eurovision #maneskin https://t.co/go4EPuG6oO
the fact that people spread drugs rumors just because they are a young rock band when they literally agreed to be tested... If it wasn’t a rock band they wouldn’t spread those rumors let’s face it #maneskin

Stop acting arrogant while proving how immature and childish you are please, it's ridiculous."
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin So the whole world works the same way, if the one they want does not win they trash the reputation of the winner.  I was hoping people in Europe were more civilized.  Hope there is an investigation and people stop hurting each other."

"@Mario23992485 @ims_ian @Eurovision @thisismaneskin My friend, two rapid points: 1) He didn't use cocaine, it is not eve thinkable in such an event like this. 2) Your amazing country (where I've been living) is the first one in Europe for cocaine usage. Try to shut the fuck up, we won, you didn't. Cheers :D"
"@joblanket @thisismaneskin Come on.  Both hands visible and clenched.  Table in front of him is not visible in this shot.  A very brief moment of lowering his head.

I do think @thisismaneskin winning is a “Loreen” moment - I could not get over all the positive tweets from non fans and *cough* heterosexuals about #Eurovision last night !   Maybe you just missed it 👀🤷🏻‍♂️😂
So just listened to @thisismaneskin's most recent release (Teatro d'ira - Vol.1) out of genuine interest and did not anticipate tune after tune after tune. Am I really going to become obsessed with an Italian rock band? I guess so 🤷‍♀️

@Djennipresso @thisismaneskin Yeah that’s true that felt so honorable as a fan of Rock n Roll . Something else then the safe listening and or surprisingly catchy songs. Normally I’m not that into the Eurovision but Italy and Finland showed that Rock is still alive and keeps surprising even the songfestival.
@xfolkloreswiftx @TheTan67053870 @BearNorthland @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin EXACTLY! Like??? It makes no sense? The only one who looked at him and nudged him was his band mate... and it was CLEARLY to make him look at the camera instead of looking at the broken glass come on...

"@Sanjuro82842057 @thisismaneskin @Eurovision Agreed not a brilliant song, but then it wasn’t the best of British talent unfortunately, but the UK getting zero over a lot of other songs  that were easily far worse musically, was biased &amp; politically motivated, if people were honest but they’re not honest are they? 🇬🇧"
@ESCShowcase @ForestFM @CiaranUT @bbceurovision @thisismaneskin @Babpravi @dadimakesmusic @gjonstearsoff Will definitely be tuning in. The UK needs to rethink it's strategy.  This year we had lazy staging (what worked for Michael Ball in 1992 won't work 30 years later) and we are relying on the glory days of the late 1970s. James did the best he could with a challenging situation.
@BBCSteveR @BBCNews @BBCWorld @BBCRadio2 @RealKenBruce @EBU_HQ @thisismaneskin Wow better than original. Thank you Steve

"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin (( How Italy was given over 300 points by the public I'll never know. Honestly the real winning competitors for me were France, Iceland, Azerbaijan or the funny dancers Lithuania. )) https://t.co/aM13uHd3Y8"
@amra3rd @Eurovision @thisismaneskin @EurovisionRai Maybe san remo? Where all the italian contestants fight for their spot
@BBCSteveR @BBCNews @BBCWorld @BBCRadio2 @RealKenBruce @EBU_HQ @thisismaneskin Eurovision isn't over until you've played the winning song!
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin A bizarre result, but after reading all the comments about unregistered votes.. Totally in line with the expected result. Rock is awesome, but this band is mediocre. I would suggest a much better public voting mechanism with for everyone a top 10 and max 1 entry / verified user"
@ChiaraTerzaroli @baumanalexandre @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Yeahh.. And kick at his right arm and smiling is for a glass👌
I see Damiano David  Immediately me:  #maneskin #damianodavid https://t.co/D8DPIzpk2y
"In all fairness to Italy it’s clear they’re not doing Coke, you can clearly see both hands of the lead singer in this video @thisismaneskin https://t.co/jAAIle3ySF"
"@Erina_Kyandoru @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I get that, I'm just saying that eurovision has always been a song contest for singers with vocals not rapping and screaming. There's a big difference and it takes more effort to actually sing good than doing what italy was doing. Could have been more professional."
"if you see me listening to the entirety of @thisismaneskin's discography, no you didn't"
@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Like any other competition very easy to test for to clear his name. Let's have a test and see? Nothing to worry about if he doesn't take drugs.
@JimJamGin @Eurovision @thisismaneskin This picture proves nothing Stop this

"@White_artemis0 @GreenOscar94 @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin I really loved France last night...but even if it were drugs, Italy still won (and the song was great). If I were French I would not want my country to win because of a disqualification-they would have to pay to host Eurovision next year for a not real win?"

"I, for one, do not believe that the chap from @thisismaneskin was taking any powdery substances. If you watch the clip, he gets down to the table too quickly and doesn’t seem to put any paper tube up his nose - he would have had to use pure nasal vacuum power 😉 #Eurovision"
I went to sleep at 11 last night and missed @thisismaneskin winning #Eurovision 😫
@Deotron @thisismaneskin @Eurovision you can’t accept that italy won pleaseee stop it
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Rubbish 🥲
@artemiseea @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Then u dont know so much abt singing i guess
"@BBCSteveR @BBCNews @BBCWorld @BBCRadio2 @RealKenBruce @EBU_HQ @thisismaneskin Nope, still don't get it. I wouldn't have bothered, mate."
@olivietta @Efeeney73 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I listen to rock and love rock. But that song is pure shit. More like shit glam rock.

@thisismaneskin @EndlessState @Eurovision Well deserved well done
@BBCSteveR @BBCNews @BBCWorld @BBCRadio2 @RealKenBruce @EBU_HQ @thisismaneskin Amazing 😁
@thisismaneskin @casanor11 Congratulations and thanks. Complimenti e grazie.
@MaP39008118 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin If you'd swap UK singing the Italian song I reckon UK would still get 0 points 🤣; it wasn't the strongest but could've got a few more points mais c'est la vie France was quite good for the passion but to me: Israel was great &amp; should've won. It's all a matter of taste of course
@Unnursvana @leggerissimah @dadimakesmusic @thisismaneskin Everybody loves Iceland

"@xfolkloreswiftx @BearNorthland @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin so that proves there was smashed glass there.. and?  how is it related to him snorting cocaine, so heres an idea for you.. there is smashed glass and also he was  caught snorting coke .. can you process that?"
@thisismaneskin @Eurovision Are you taking coke at the table ? My God what a bad thing to do in public … why didn’t they test you right away? If this was a joke it really  was a bad joke … and bad example for my grandkids …
318 points! That moment 🙌#Maneskin @thisismaneskin #Italy https://t.co/afqX0hHCUt
#maneskin 3 albums on iTunes and the winning song is on one of those albums. Whatever happened to amateurs entering and writing a song especially for the contest. Rock won it! How about Def Leppard Or Iron Maiden for the UK? We'd get noticed for sure! Cats n Pigeons! #Eurovision
Me every time that I listen to Maneskin #maneskin https://t.co/z5y3UD2NmC
"A rock song won the Eurovision song contest, that’s pretty f**king cool #maneskin 🔥"
its been like 5 days since i started listening to måneskin and i literally listened just to their songs all day on repeat. But it feels like i liked them for months :D and i still kinda cant believe that they won eurovision like wow im so proud of them #maneskin
in love with all of you &lt;3 @thisismaneskin https://t.co/IucLnq5PAY
i’m still not done taking about #Eurovision @thisismaneskin were so good and their entire discography is elite so go check them out
"@MaccaTheFourth UK is backward looking, whilst Europe looks forward.  Year after year, our song entry is:what won last year, let’s replicate that. Whilst the rest have moved on.   Could you ever think of #maneskin being voted for in UK. Of course not, because we stuck in the past.  #Eurovision"

"@Rattlesnake64 @tancredipalmeri @thisismaneskin For this that’s not my problems 😅 but they can accept of being tEsted, because it’s clearly obvious that Damiano didn’t and doesn’t take drugs"
"@bexopinionated @Eurovision @thisismaneskin It's obvious that we can't have the same taste in music but it's important to express your opinion in a civil way. If you can't accept your loss and you have the need to hate who won, I'm sorry but I'm happy you didn't win (even if the songs of Switzerland and France were good)"
@Atlantis1316 @leggerissimah @dadimakesmusic @thisismaneskin The jury gave Iceland more points than the public did. What are you on about.

@TheTan67053870 @BearNorthland @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin and your accusing someone to be a drug addict just by an alleged video that has been confirmed false by them. You should mind your business and stop accusing people of such false and grave things

"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin The uk should just pull out of this comp, it’s so political and laughable"
"@suc_mel @MsVale14 @louisxcherriez @christiancalgie @thisismaneskin The knee was a clear warning sign. You knowing the drummers name shows that you’re a fan girl and can’t think objectively.

"@debishot @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Boring song to me. As an Italian I am happy Italy won (really wanted it this year, and it is not for the country because in 2017 I REALLY rooted for Portugal). It was a difficult song to sing, no more than that. Italy and Ukraine (my 12 points) were lit."

@laney74 @thisismaneskin It’s a great song mate. Been listening to it this morning. Have you noticed the similarity between Maneskin’s lead singer and Butch Walker from his Marvelous 3 days?!

@JakChirak4 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin funny how people can't accept that there are other types of music other than cheesy pop
"@Turpdotnet @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I know, and I feel sorry for that. As a simple Italian who loves London and has visited dozens of times, next year I'll need a passport and everything will be more complicated. Let alone people in the import/export business and the showbiz."

@andreateslini @thisismaneskin A great choice Andrea. They should call the song “Cardano” which means cardan shaft (see picture) in honor of @ScuderiaFerrari . Do not mistake it for cardamo or cardamomum which is a spice that they put in seftalies here in Ayia Napa. I’m sure Bossikan would eat a lot of them. https://t.co/44BaxWs5rs

@sophiefotini @willyleeadams @thisismaneskin He wasn’t that awful though. He wasn’t. Not the worst in the competition. And the song most certainly wasn’t. It’s just a very bitter pill to swallow as I think anyone would be lying if they said it was genuinely the worst song/performance of the night.

"Statement from Maneskin about the accusations that Damiano would do drugs/cocaine during Eurovision. Y'all should be ashamed!

"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Serbia received 80 votes from the audience.  I sent the 10th myself, which means to the whole of Europe that on average 8 people just voted.  Hello people ...

"Just because they're a rock band, it doesn't mean that they're bad guys and they do drugs. That's a stereotype and someone who listens to metal just like me should perfectly know that...😅  Anyway, it was explained here, as well 👇   #Maneskin   https://t.co/YsBT2689Bm"
"Actually no, Damiano was just laughing and that it's pretty clear. Not only they don't do drugs, but it was impossible to do it at the #Eurovision with all the cameras and the crowd. They even had to censore the lyrics of ""Zitti e Buoni"", come on...  #Måneskin #ESCita https://t.co/f0VJAjTMWW https://t.co/sVmU6inOVx"
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin If it's not your 'cup of tea',that doesn't mean that you can roast it and finding a way to disqualify them. Just chill out, listen to every song from Eurovision 2021,cuz i personally think that all of the songs were SO GOOD this year and every country sent an artist with big hits"
@pochotustra @thisismaneskin Pfft! They were amazeballs! Like Mötley Crüe and KISS got together and recruited Stevie Nicks. I'm here for it!!! 🤩
@thisismaneskin Congrats! You deserve this❤️
"Il @nytimes sulla vittoria dei #maneskin a #Eurovision #ESCita  “Eurovision 2021 will certainly go down in the history books. Not only because of Italy’s victory, but also because this was the largest in-person entertainment event in Europe since the start of the pandemic”. https://t.co/ffBfHV4PAi"
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Why is it political? The only way to humiliate Britain is by giving It 0 points meanwhile Britain is ahead with its vaccine programme compared with EU. Bitter much EU. Tbh it’s a show filled with talentless idiots
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin So just support the art and stop being so judgemental of them. Also, if you're not fan of rock&amp;roll (and for example i don't usually listen to that genre), this competition accepts every kind of music and that's why it sticks out."

"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Yeah, some countries were damaged and i also think that some of them didn't deserve that much of a low points, but i also think that Italy had the best song - good lyrics, melody, their energy. It's different, it sticks out and it was A BOOMB."
@AnaAscencao @thisismaneskin It’s their concert in Bruxelles? 🔥

"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Everyone has its own taste. Don't understand why you all put rhis amount of critics into the song. Lots of the other seemed a nursery rhyme. Moreover, italians couldn't vote  for them so i think other europeans did! And not because it's rock so it shouldn't have won....."

"@CostoDormite @Filbert631 @ElizaPlayss @Eurovision @thisismaneskin True, but Portugal won in 2017 I think and Portuguese are not the biggest diaspora. I’m not into Italian songs that much but in general they seem to be quite popular overseas, and not only by Italians"
"@GaelLepanda @thisismaneskin @Eurovision Fuck you. That is a paper towel. If your fucking preferred song didn’t win, deal with it and don’t make nonsense allegations. In a global tv show, the singer uses cocaine in front of the cameras. It sounds like a joke."

@FCP26_ @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I don't care if it has to do with population. I am happy that the UK had ZERO point because the purpose of  BREXIT is literally to promote their xenophobia and racism. It will serve them right. UK should go back to being an inclusive country.

@vasomuse @Luka98329191 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I’m tired of the same recycled pop songs Eastern Europe brings EVERY TIME. They don’t have other types of music... No wonder they never win anything.

"@AThesenvitz @Hristovv_b @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Never said it wasn't bold if all I think is true, but wouldn't surprise me really. Like I said, no one can know so no one can come at me and tell me I'm wrong if none of us knows.   Did they agree to take a test or/and are they going to ?"
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin We were this close to perfection! https://t.co/i8vwDAHtTd
"@Lydia6244 @Hristovv_b @Eurovision @thisismaneskin my point is no one should simply jump to conclusions and accuse them of something as bad as doing cocaine on live tv, when the camera angle isn’t clear.. seriously maybe he was just screaming into his phone, maybe not, we can’t see.. the drug results will clear the situation"
"@SooMicchi @the_eurofan @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin You think about it too much when is simpler than that. Some environments are more prone to make people do certain things, and rock has always been and always be about the attitude and drugs are part of that. Is not calling anyone into rock a junkie, is what it is"
"@elletyttue @Filbert631 @ElizaPlayss @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Not really because the expert votes are from local and linked more to political geographical connection. If you notice the televote since they count separately (from 2016) Italy had high score. In 2019 we arrived second from 5, in 2018 we arrived 5 from 12"

"@Lydia6244 @Hristovv_b @Eurovision @thisismaneskin no one can know.. all I’m saying is that it’s hard to believe that they’re all so irresponsible as to just keep a bunch of cocaine on the table.. anyways, they agreed to take a drug test so we’ll see"

@Lydia6244 @diesomnius @snvdl17 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Use your common sense. There is intense security. How could they bypass the security and bring drugs into the venue without anyone noticing it?

@Lydia6244 @Hristovv_b @Eurovision @thisismaneskin it’s not logic.. if he is screaming out of excitement or whatever and he’s distracted and the camera is coming around of course he’ll stop and get up.. don’t assume the worst! anyway they already agreed to take a drug test so we’ll see!

"@Lydia6244 @Hristovv_b @Eurovision @thisismaneskin their manager is right next to them! I think their manager is smart enough to know that it would be a big problem if they got caught doing drugs! so if they really had drugs on the table, don’t you think she would tell them to put them away?"
"@jazz6582 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin If you watch a replay, there is no way he had time to snort drugs ..it’s sort of 1-2-3-4– and up, looks to the side.  He would also have wiped his nose.  And they were, apparently, a favourite."

"@Lydia6244 @diesomnius @snvdl17 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin 1. His head was nowhere near the table. You can see his head right at the angle of the top of the beer bottles, so his head would be at least a few cm from the table.  2. How would someone inhale something in one second? It doesn’t make sense"

It's obvious we all have different taste in music so what's the point."
"@Eclipse_Ocelot @Aphrodisias95 @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin I'm sure the Eurovision security is so lax that nobody notices people smuggling drugs in, and all of the cameras are set up to black out drugs automatically, and he chose to bring drugs during the GRAND FINAL but not the rest of the competition. Seems legit."

"Not a fan of #maneskin and I have sympathy for my fellow countrymen who next year they have to endure the #Eurovision in addition to the #festivaldisanremo BTW, if you do not know, the Eurovision was modeled on the festival di Sanremo. Maybe they can spare one then! https://t.co/xugDdUBKMw"
"@FilipOrvik @thisismaneskin @Eurovision I read that it's Danish actually. They adopted this name because they were searching for a name to participate in a local contest in 2016 and the other members asked the bass player (Victoria) who is half Danish, to toss out some Danish words."
I am SO proud of my fellow country (and in parts my hometown) men. @BlindChannelFIN showed how to rock the whole Europe. Much love to @thisismaneskin for winning! This year was something different. So many good and worthy potential winners. Eurovision for the win! #esc2021 #umk

"So, let me get this straight: Damiano is snorting with cameras everywhere, with his managers next to him, without using his hands and with his nose at about 30cm from the table.  Are you sure he's the one who is taking drugs?   #Eurovision #maneskin #cocaine #stupidpeople https://t.co/Nm5Ypr6p4o"

@yeraycampos_ @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin I think the disrespect is implying that someone who has just won an award has taken drugs during a live broadcast when he clearly didn't. Simply an immature  way to ruin a fantastic night for a band that has worked extremely hard to get to where they are now.

@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Maybe they should have asked him why the dude next to him his like giving damiano an elbow when the camera is on him? If it's legit a glass that's broken he didn't have to do it. But he did it because he's warning damiano for the coke thing.
@APadders @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Sweden's best song was with Måns and Heroes. Best song in eurovision to be honest.

Oh and check your ableism."

"@petjii @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Lol. Shut the fuck up! Accept Italy won. They asked him in the press conference and he said one if his bandmates broke a glass, he was looking down to check if he stepped on it. Now fuck off, love from 🇮🇹! #EUROVISION"
@TweetBlakemore @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Thank you for informing me!
"Oh people, when I’m reading some of your comments I’m so embarrassed... I don’t know if you are jealous or just stupid, shut up and behave, I’m having a glass of Prosecco in honor of sassy kings and a queen. Legends 🤟🏻 #maneskin #Eurovision2021 #EUROVISION"

"@anth0888 @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin No. Only people who are snide and can't be bothered to actually watch the video. He clearly clenches both fists and makes a little grimace like people do when they hear good news or win something.

@thisismaneskin @Eurovision Rock'n'roll Babe 🤘
@shoneskin_ @thisismaneskin @Eurovision I LOVE HIM
So French people are hoping for the disqualification of Italy? They failed to win and now they want to steal the victory from us? The public has chosen. The public overturned the result. Get over it. 🤍  #Eurovision2021 #Italy #Maneskin https://t.co/iQfeIoadQi

@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin If he gets disqualified for coke I will not watch next year and I say that as a mega fan. I adore them and they deserved that win. As if they would be the ONLY artists who MAYBE had more than alcohol in their system after they performed and chilled in the green room.

"@namulittlemiaw @AlesESC @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Oh and if you think it’s unlikely someone would take drugs at a *music event*, I’m afraid you’re very much mistaken given how rife drug use is in that industry.

@yeraycampos_ @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin What we have seen? A guy leaning over a table but not having the nose close enough to the surface and with both hands clenched in a fist. Never seen an actor faking snorting? You have to press the finger on one nostrils to be able to effectively snort the drug.
@FluubZ @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Bruh last time italy won was 30 years ago...
@stephan_pierre_ @Eurovision @thisismaneskin It was like this pre Brexit. Nothing’s changed. They hate the UK. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"@jenselevens @chrisarthur01 @thisismaneskin That's what I thought at first but his hands are not holding anything to snort the coke with, if he snorted it without any tool,then his nose would have to be  pressed against the table, which is not the case,also even the worst addict wouldn't do coke in front of millions of ppl"
"Ok one more #Eurovision tweet  I find it fun that the drummer from @thisismaneskin seems to be the quietest of all of them, when in the US the drummer tends to be the loudest.    Drummers are still the hottest tho."

@thisismaneskin @Eurovision DESERVED!!!!
@Matt31451124 @jenselevens @thisismaneskin Clearly the fiver must be already up his nose or invisible (must be one of those new Euro notes) because BOTH his hands are seen in the video at his sides .... and pretty sure last time I checked that’s were that fiver should be to do a line.?
@thisismaneskin @Eurovision You guys definetly got one fan from Finland!
@romz______ @FCP26_ @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Well as someone watching it for the last 15 years.... it's becoming better ....

"@__Exois__ @giogiorubbish @the_eurofan @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Oh yes I have seen people, including friends, snort coke quite a few times. Once the powder is properly aligned on the table no need for hands to snort it. But here, we can clearly see your buddy's left hand very close to the line to make sure he doesn't miss a single gram !"
"@megan24173859 @PatrikLiba1 @andrew8912 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Ukraine and Russia juries gave each country no points this year, and the the televote between each was only 7pts and 4pts respectively. Hardly a great example of this  If anything the Nordics are worse at this, but in all honesty I don't think bloc voting matters as much anymore"

@TweetBlakemore @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I am pretty sure the Eurovision's organisers have already clear that. He is not that dumb to do such a thing when cameras are everywhere.

@Lydia6244 @marianxvxrri @AlexMagd @countylad84 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Yeah if Polanski made the best movie and the oscasr wanna reward the best movie. You should see them separate. That's why you making this political and all makes a arbitrary award show even worse. We just look at the favourite songs of Europe through a point system.

"@chrisarthur01 @thisismaneskin Lool, yeah because when you cheer you definitely bend down towards a table. And the lead singer himself claims his bandmate (who suspiciously nudges him as he appears to be snorting) broke a glass. Since when did breaking a glass resemble either ""cheering"" or coke sniffing?"

I’m just waiting for @thisismaneskin and @BlindChannelFIN ‘a song #Eurovision
"@Karolita_Net @Eurovision @thisismaneskin @GjonsTearsFans @gjons_tears ""Because this “public vote”it’s not about music just about popularity.""  Are you sure that it's not the Jury vote that is about which country is liked by others and which is not??"
These guys just won #Eurovision2021. I don’t normally pay attention to that contest but this winning song by @thisismaneskin is pretty damn good. https://t.co/7gIDtepL5Z https://t.co/LvObvdxJc8
@AlbertaNewsNow1 @samobobnar @LDav000 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin This comment.... Did you not do geography at school 🤦‍♂️
"@Ellyssima @Eurovision @thisismaneskin A fact as there r short, average and tall ppl around the world and tht includes women. Men heels worn by Tom Cruise via the instep. A fashion for guys during the 70’s glam rock era &amp; looks like a return."
@1betti8 @thisismaneskin @Eurovision @EurovisionRai bringing up 2006 football when we're the current world champions? bold move lmao
"@_theVikingGamer @thisismaneskin So two things, but a caveat first: let's assume was taking drugs. If so 1) regardless, people still preferred this song and it was popular with the judges and 2) the UK STILL couldn't have won. I'm with you, as you know, but we could be gracious in defeat..."
@Hristovv_b @Lydia6244 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Because he would obviously say « yes i did use coke » 💀
@RavePigeon @giogiorubbish @petebeddard @JAmmonpira @the_eurofan @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Then why the fuck you on here?
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Stop drogs
"OMG, that was the best four hours I’ve had in awhile. Thank you @peacockTV for making @Eurovision available! 🙌🥰  Huge congrats, @thisismaneskin!!!💥  #Eurovision2021 #EUROVISION https://t.co/3fqKQ3ST7F"

@Eurovision @thisismaneskin So many bitter comments 😂 Love it because I voted for them 💚🤍❤️
@chartdata @thisismaneskin SAY IT LOUDERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
"@thisismaneskin asap i'll buy tickets to your next live show/concert and i'm definetly attending next year's eurovision!! sending lots of love to you rockstars,, so happy you won!!"
@thisismaneskin @Eurovision CONGRATSS YALL DESERVED IT
@TriskyHD @Eurovision @thisismaneskin If instagram is a drug you could be right https://t.co/SRispTFCZ2
"@snydeshop @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Also that ""pile"" circulating on the internet isn't even a pile. They'd try to hide something like that because they have tall glasses. But no. It's clearly visible. It's even in front of ESC staff, that's how visible it is. If you're dumb, just say so."
@thisismaneskin he is from itsly
"@la_mandarinette @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin First he doesn’t need to prove anything to you or anyone, second it’s his life, third it’s a singing competition, blood tests are against his human rights since he didn’t commit a crime."
@CalendulaMk @GhibliOof @MatthewLumby @Eurovision @thisismaneskin you just said it. his bandmate kicking him so he would look into the camera. what's wrong with that when you're watched by millions of people? 🤷🏻‍♀️
"@anninaaaaaaaaa1 @ChareeOkee @oldbeecharmer @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Yeah, he was just sniffing broken glass. I don’t understand the issue. Nothing wrong with snorting broke glass. Nope."
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin UK should send Bring Me The Horizon next year, come on!"
"@thisismaneskin congratulations from Spain, hope ur celebrating ur victory and I hope one day we can see u on tour here. We're drinking some beers in ur honor."
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Stop drogs in direct please
"@natrev__ @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Lmao do you really think that is cocaine? It could be anything, to me it looks like a napkin. Also his hands were free and he was too far away from the table to be snorting anything."
@Eurovision @ayeshahazarika @thisismaneskin I loved the shadowy figures of the real musos behind these mime artists. Truly the Milli Vanilli of Eurovision.
"@a_d_cavallo @kerry1hart @z_jvd @Eurovision @thisismaneskin That's great, I wanted them or Finland to win and I'd prefer to go to Italy next year for eurovision than to France"
"@JFauray @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin out of reasons, no words and no justification.. your thesis is so poor you have to use sarcasm to defend yourself.. zitto e buono"
@pensacheculo_ @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Absolutely not
@anninaaaaaaaaa1 @oldbeecharmer @Coggit @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin You may be right. People will see what they want to see mostly. The French have a reason to want Italy to lose.  I have no agenda. It just looks very suspicious to me BUT there may be a very honest explanation. For Italy’s sake I hope there is. I would love to go Italy next year.
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Shite
@snvdl17 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Ah ah ah... he's NOT using drugs. He just put his face on his knees. Grab your glasses
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Congratulations....... https://t.co/sJjR7TACyE
"@TonyAguilarOfi @thisismaneskin Wow..... so the winners of the #EUROVISION are smashed off their faces on coke 🙄what a joke, and they wonder why no one watches this shit🤦🏻‍♀️"
@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin It’s pretty clear he is not doing coke but it does look like it if you’ve never done it before. So..  definitly looks like he is to me!  Um what?
Yes!! We are going to Rome 2022!! Congratulations  @thisismaneskin Thanks for the great show  @Eurovision   Here are my 12 points from Puerto Rico!!! #Eurovision #Eurovision2021 #ESC #ESC2021 https://t.co/FltPOrbtKL
@Lydia6244 @diesomnius @snvdl17 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin And I’m pretty sure staff and security would’ve taken care of it.
@forevergio @zahi2608 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Is it allowed to poke a drug-using friend in eurovision?
"@BlusignDesign @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin you know what? it can be an option, but if we don't have proof, nobody can affirm nothing. tuddles"
@michellevisage 🇮🇹 “I don’t use drugs.”  ⚠️ Damiano from @thisismaneskin says that bandmate Thomas broke a glass in the green room. They were NOT snorting cocaine as Twitter has suggested.    https://t.co/arri3oXxcb
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Wow actual Europeans won, not the shit Netherlands and Sweden sent."
@thisismaneskin @Eurovision Congratulations! I loved your performance. You deserved it!

@spacesmiIer @thisismaneskin This and vent'anni are on repeat since yesterday. So beautiful
"@Lydia6244 @diesomnius @snvdl17 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Please use some common sense, i highly doubt he’s that stupid to do drugs on tv in front of the whole world. He explained that one of the members broke a glass and he was picking it up. Plus I highly doubt he would snort it that quick with his head so far from the table :)"
@jzlotnitsky @AmitLiad @Eurovision @thisismaneskin You must be one of those blaming antisemitism even when you overcook your pasta...😽
"@Lydia6244 @marianxvxrri @AlexMagd @countylad84 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Also what are you pressed about? It was just a good song that won. Remember the song for what it is and not for something people imagine him doing. It's not like you don't listen to edith piaf anymore cause she was edicted to coke. No, music stands alone"
@iamryuka @P1Bliss @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin We didn't stole in 2006 you have to say thank you to zidane. We played well and we won and now shut the fuck up stupid person.
"So at the press conference Ethan (the drummer) asked all the journalists for a round of applause for all the artists who put so much effort into their music and this event.  They aren't just talented, they are also very nice. #EUROVISION #maneskin 💕 https://t.co/tuxUA2Hu0S"
"@wiwibloggs @Cabbot_ @thisismaneskin Does it makes sense to whose saying this crap he could not sing ""cazzo"" (dick) and they had to change the lyrics but they could walk in with cocaine and sniffing it peacefully in front of that many cameras? 👁️👄👁️"

For everyone saying that the singer of #Maneskin was snorting cocaine during #Eurovision. He claims there was a broken glass. I'm guessing he was bending down to pick it up. I doubt he / they would risk bringing and doing drugs to such a guarded and televised event. #Italy #ITA https://t.co/J1NkpfZ76Z

@preciousxlpayne @AlexMagd @countylad84 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Do you think Eurovision had 0 security checks? I mean with Covid and everything else I think it would hard to bring stuff in
@_nopaynenogain @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Like somebody else here said in the comments ... Do a drug test.
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Drugs were allowed To perform better  ?

@PeakeCondition @ForeverAYellow @Eurovision @thisismaneskin @JamesNewmanUk Yes but I meant the English abroad. In Zurich there are many here and most of my friends from the UK were embarrassed with him.
@yuno_jaegar @_joshrfc @zeno490BC @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Ukraine and Italy were my Top 2. I liked France but I just don’t get how Switzerland got so many votes. They were sooooooo boring and I didn’t feel passion from them at all (unlike France which was slow but clearly full of passion)
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Like I'm not surprised https://t.co/ruyUXHPS3k
"@P1Bliss @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin It's not only France and fortunately everybody doesn't think like this. Coke or not, Italy won thanks to the public vote, it's undeniable. A disqualification is not a nice way to win a contest."

"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin now @EurovisionRai gets to consider one of these venues for them to host 2022 Eurovision: -PalaLottomatica, Roma -Mediolanum Forum, Milano (my personal suggestion) -Pala Alpitour, Torino -Unipol Arena, Bologna -Vitrifrigo Arena, Pesaro"
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Great show but the results are seem fraude. Brexit doesn´t mean that uk artist only for that 0 points.

@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin not people actually think he was snorting coke💀
@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin and just think about that: they couldn't possibly had drugs with them in the green room because there's SECURITY who is always checking on them and all the members of the delegation. please JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT what accusing a person of these things means. u could potentially-
"@nzoow387 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin And FIY, they have denied any use of illegal substances during the press conference that is ongoing on Eurovision YT channel, so… let’s just get some sleep shall we? 👀"

@jzlotnitsky @AmitLiad @Eurovision @thisismaneskin These antisemitic acts are from a small minority. The large majority of the European population does not uphold these values. Blaming Israel not winning on antisemitism is a bit much

@snvdl17 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I looked at the clip a few times &amp; he was either wiping his nose on the table clothe or doing something else. What clinched it for me was the guy on the left saw the camera was filming looked down at him &amp; nudged him under the table to warn him.

@IAmWSmirat @Eurovision @thisismaneskin They deserved it. They had great presence on stage which is something I cannot say for many of the rest. They did a professional job. Just because you happen to not like the style does not mean they didn't deserve it
@BearNorthland @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin You can’t even see where his nose goes. Just the fact that some of you believe that they are so stupid to pour coke on a table in front a thousand cameras makes me worried. Get a life instead of looking to downgrade others.

@Lydia6244 @AlexMagd @countylad84 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin That we have killer parties and drugs in Europe? That when you snort coke you write winning songs?

"@Eclipse_Ocelot @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Ahahahah okay, now try to say that without crying😂😂😂"
I still can't believe that @thisismaneskin won #Eurovision It was a dream coming true!!

@Eurovision @thisismaneskin We wish to advise all our wonderful viewers that we are aware of the incident with the Italy winners and suspected drug taking we are currently investigating this thoroughly.
"@cameliaboban @thisismaneskin Thanks, did not know that there were two versions!"
"@DemNahReady @imperialpop_ @Eurovision @thisismaneskin You don't want to deny that you are wrong even in front of the evidence. On the other hand, if you were Italian you would also know that in several interviews they said not to use drugs and advised against doing so (and being a rocker they would have no disadvantage to admit it)"
@vaysaeri @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Couldn’t agree more
"@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Yeah, when I break a glass, I regularly sniff it up..."
The voting tonight at #eurovision was probably the best I have seen in many years.  Well done to #maneskin

"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Very happy because the 3 first were not english songs. I don’t understand why other countries refuse to use their own language? Greek, Serbian, Finnish , even German are beautiful language. Stop use international and business language, be proud of your language."
@FedericoC1993 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Why should I like something just cos it won??? Get a grip 😂🤣
@Kitty_458 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin man i have a feeling y'all are just to hurt or something to not admit that Italy won cuz it was deserved...succhiami il cazzo ahah

Italy Wins #Eurovision with #maneskin. I think next year we’ll see more music produced with guitars rather than loops and sample packs. And people will like to see live shows with musicians instead of laptops. I am not a fan of them but i’m happy about this! #musicproduction

@donnie86dc @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Every year there’s always a lot of unhappiness about the winning song but I guess ppl feel they can be louder on this app. Btw I was shocked and disgusted that he was caught doing lines on camera so maybe that’s why too. They’re. They’re not your average winners though!
Måneskin will 100% gain international fame and appreciation in a very short time mark my words! #maneskin #Eurovision

Yaass winners 😍 #italy #maneskin #Eurovision
"@fab_seventies @stevejknight @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Germany has won 2 times only in all these years. They also put in a lot of funds in this. Why people can't just enjoy the show and not start whining about pulling out. Yeah, there's politics under mostly, but... It was a great show and a moment to forget about the real world 💜"

"@megan24173859 @stargrazzer @Eurovision @thisismaneskin It really isn’t. Whoever chooses the songs for the UK needs to be fired, like 20 years ago. I mean we have x factor, Britain’s got talent and all that other garbage, why can’t we have something similar for Eurovision but they also have to pen their own songs?"
@PolMarin06 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Me too

@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Absolutely awesome result! Rock has won once more! The jury is deaf though. Because Finland and Italy would have been numers 1 and 2 if the jury didn't vote politicaly but by actually listening to the songs ;)

@Calopumi @thelifeofmonty @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I think people across the globe forget how much the uk actually do for everyone. Pretty sure if we shut our borders everyone would cause an out roar. Same if we pulled funding. Ignorance across Europe seems to be constant until they all need something.

@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Sorry but  this results are fraude. UK 0 points after  brexit is not fair and it´s ugly that a artist is punished. The contradiction that switserland have so low points from public even he was a gorgeous singer is horor. Also belgium deserve more. ESC is now a political circus.

@reddzeppelin @thisismaneskin Finland was a strong entry too; glad to see they finished high up the order as well.
@zeno490BC @andrew1tm @Eurovision @thisismaneskin Ukraine deserved the win more than italy tho. I do agree that the voting is political bullshit
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin But the german guy, who was responsible for the german comments wasn't nice at all! From bodyshaming with hair or the not so ""shiny"" comment about Swedens song choice! The list about him is sooo long! It was straight a diss! We want to spread love!!! Not hate comments!"

Gotta admit I’m a #jurytype voter apparently this year - despite ranking Italy highly too...  🤪 but #rock indeed #willneverdie CONGRATS #Italy #Eurovision #eurovision2021 #maneskin
@REALJOHNPAUL97 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin They really must change ( or throw away) yury voting. As always some countries yury votes on neighbours with good relations like 🇬🇷 - 🇨🇾 or 🇲🇹 for example.  Why only audience votes doesn't count?

@haw_rose @jordan_sufc96 @Eurovision @thisismaneskin I’ve visited Italy and true people are more likable maybe but still Italy’s song was charismatic and it didn’t aim to be too edgy like Blind Channel’s one
@Efeeney73 @IAmWSmirat @Eurovision @thisismaneskin *everyone disliked that*
Congrsts from Poland! @thisismaneskin Well deserved! ROCK AND ROLL NEVER DIES! Thank you for the emotions tonight. I want to go to your show ASAP!

@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Hard to believe... Switzerland was absolutely the best tonight.
@Eurovision @thisismaneskin lets be real.  this contest is all political.  switzerland had the best song on the show.  italy did not even have to qualify they got an automatic in.  the televote every year for Italy is always more.   and also the UK was treated like shit.  shame!!!!
just how fast the night changes @thisismaneskin https://t.co/vYvxDVe3nr
"@Eurovision @thisismaneskin Congratulations Italy - worst winner in the history of Eurovision. James Newman deserved Nul points for an awful performance, but so did Italy."

I'd just like to say that #Måneskin means moonlight in Norwegian (and probably in Swedish &amp; Danish too) - I wonder if the Italian band who won #Eurovision2021 know that or did they just pick it out of a dictionary ????? 🤪 And do we really care 😳😫🥴

"@RodyTheRoad @SakkoTheTaco @Eurovision @thisismaneskin It's not as if we've done multiple things to make most EU members royally pissed at us.  Yeah, it sucks. It's also a talent show and those are about who you like more often than who deserves the win."

@YannickBZHCOL @wiwibloggs @destinymusicmt @thisismaneskin @Babpravi For Ukraine i don't know maybe the third place or second.

@ohyeahyeahfire @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin It's because I'm worried about Italy's chances of winning being destroyed by the jury.

"@j4lambert @wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin none of the other artists are. maneskin are probably the most famous there (except for flo rida), they had numerous concerts all over europe"

@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin It’s France turn now 🇫🇷
"@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin When The Netherlands won in 2019, it was 44 years since their last #Eurovision victory in 1975.  France last won #Eurovision in 1977. That's 44 years.  We'll see if 44 is a lucky number again."
@_mizbeehavior_ @thisismaneskin We don't think this will be the case this year. I sense a major upset incoming.
@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin But this is not going to happen. Måneskin isn't well known outside its home country...
"@wiwibloggs @thisismaneskin Every time you say Italy are favourites they never actually win, so let's not bring bad luck to them please!"

"@thisismaneskin The cliche is that Italy has produced the world’s greatest art and cuisine but never a decent band – and Eurovision, meanwhile, isn’t exactly where you go for rock’n’roll. Any guitars tend to sound extremely synthetic, and are usually used for power chords accompanying a metal"
