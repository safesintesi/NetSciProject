SUMMARY OF THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROJECT
Main goal: studying the "push" that a festival can have on the contestants and find out if the effect extends to similar artists
Case study: Maneskin (and other participants) at Eurovision 2021

1. Collecting Tweets of users mentioning Eurovision 2021 participants (@ and #) in the time span April 1 - August 1 2021
2. Cleaning the Tweets and sending them to prof. Erseghe for word counting
3. Building a bipartite network where nodes are users and artists, connected by edges which weight is determined by the number of Tweets in which the user mentioned
   the artist and (optionally) their feelings towards them. The evolution of the network in the considered time span will be of interest
4. (Optional) Build a semantic network for each artist and find centrality correlation (suggested by prof. Erseghe)
5. Build a second network, this time the nodes are only artists. Edges are weighted using the previous network as a proximity measure (the stronger the link, the more
   listeners in common)
6. Study of the temporal evolution of the networks and graphs
7. (Very optional) See if the same phenomenon happened in previous versions of Eurovision
